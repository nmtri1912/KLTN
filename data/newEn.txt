Vietnam passes one week with zero new Covid-19 cases.
Vietnam reported no fresh Covid-19 infections this morning, April 23, marking a full week in which the country's total number of coronavirus cases was kept unchanged at 268.
Of the total, 223 patients have made a full recovery and been discharged from hospital, according to the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control.
Among the 45 cases under treatment at eight medical centers, 11 patients have tested negative once or twice for the virus, the local media reported.
Meanwhile, the three critically ill patients, including the 19th and 161st receiving treatment at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Dong Anh District, Hanoi City and the 91st under treatment at HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases, have shown some health improvements.
Despite the positive signal, residents should not be inattentive and should continue to strictly follow Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures, including wearing face masks, avoiding mass gatherings and standing apart from one another, said Associate Professor Dr Tran Dac Phu, former head of the General Department of Preventive Medicine.
