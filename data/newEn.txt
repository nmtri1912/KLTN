Vietnam reports no new Covid-19 patient.
Vietnam has not recorded new coronavirus Covid-19 infections Sunday morning, keeping the country's tally at 240, the Health Ministry said.
Of the current 240 Covid-19 cases, 90 have been discharged.
As many as 149 cases are Vietnamese nationals returning from abroad, mostly Europe and the U.S., and more than 60 people are related to the Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi and Buddha Bar & Grill in HCM, Vietnam's biggest Covid-19 hotspots.
Vietnam entered a 15-day nationwide social distancing campaign starting Wednesday, not allowing gatherings of more than two people and asking people not to leave their homes to contain the spread of the pandemic.
The government also suspended all inbound international flights and halted road transport services until April 15 to limit travel in the country of 94 million people.
The Covid-19 pandemic has so far spread to more than 200 countries and territories, claiming more than 64,000 lives.
