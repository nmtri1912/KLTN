The 45th President of the United States of America – Donald Trump, he beaten off one of the former President’s wife named Hilary Clinton and has taken office on January 20, 2017.
Actually, he has already risen to fame as a business magnate and TV personality far before he moves to live in the White House.
However, unlike other previous ones, this President has been frequently criticized and hit the headlines.
As he took up office, Trump immediately managed to hobble Obamacare – one of the biggest achievements of his previous, President Obama.
The action made public opinion break out, and people not only in the USA but also in the world called him the cruel guy.
Obamacare was an act that make health insurance available for US citizens, especially the poor, and its official name of the law is the Affordable Care Act.
However, President Trump considered this act completely the opposite with one of important American values, independence, which means that the America, regardless of the rich of the poor, must be self-reliant and depends on no one to feed and finance them.
As a result, he got rid of this law and was strongly censured.
Recently, President Donald Trump has grabbed the headlines of many magazines regardless inside or outside the USA for throwing a grenade triggering the commercial war between his nation and China.
The press acknowledged that he is hobbling China because this nation’s economy is getting bigger and might gulp his USA down in a near future.
However, it is true that this trade war is the economic sanctions after mischief and tricks China did not only with the business but also the politics of America.
It is not wrong for people to say that he is evil, but he just does the right things and protects the Americans.
Kim Jong Un is the Supreme Leader of North Korea who has been in power since 2011.
Although he has been well-known recently, his life is still a mystery to the world.
He was born in the early 1980s to singer Ko Young Hee and North Korea dictator Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather was Kim Il Sung – founder of the Kim dynasty.
Though Kim Jong Un had an elder brother and half-brother, his father still chose him as his successor.
After his father’s death in 2011, Kim ascended to power.
Unlike other presidents, Kim has a harsh and fierce policy of governance and leadership.
It is said that the leader of North Korea – Kim Jong Un is extremely cruel, dangerous but not crazy.
His pursuit of nuclear weapons, incendiary rhetoric and odd appearance prove to that saying.
Kim instructs his guys to create a very strong advanced and dangerous nuclear weapons that threaten the strongest nation in terms of military – the United States, and President Trump has to scratch his head over the nuclear weapon agreement with the two in order to persuade him uninstalling all of the booms.
This is the reason why we have the US – North Korean Singapore and Hanoi Summit.
Not only the military system is focused, but also all areas of daily life in North Korea which are strictly controlled by Kim’s regime is the topic of many discussions.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is home to more than 24 million people living under a harsh form of communist rule.
People have to ask permission to travel around and it is difficult for visitors to enter the country.
All TVs and radios are tuned to state channels and people are caught listening to foreign broadcasts face harsh punishments.
These controls make most North Koreans have little or even no idea of the outside world, and it is seemed that these citizens are trapped in caged.
The world, especially Mr.Trump of the US are doing their best to make at least small changes to this country and help its people have chance to meet the outside.
Facebook is one of the most popular and biggest social media globally that most of the people worldwide use and access everyday.
It provide us with smart and convenient features that help us connect to the outside world without going anywhere but stay at home or office only;
morever, people nowadays can work and study or go shopping online at home via Facebook.
However, despite these brilliant features, it is argued that Facebook also has its own psychological costs that are bad for the human being’s mental health.
To be more specific concerning the side effects of the social medium – Facebook, firstly, it can become addictive and causes intense passivity and weak communication.
Besides society’s most common addictive substances like coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol, it is obviously that Facebook – a cyber phenomenon in the world – has been becoming a serious addiction got by people in all ages.
In fact, friends, families, colleagues and partners nowadays are no longer happy and excited in engaging a face-to-face conversation.
They even feel disconcerted because of having nothing to say with each other.
Intepreting for this strange and popular situation, Facebook is one of the reason that people have been blaming on.
Myriad people daily spend hours to browse Facebook, in other words, they are becoming phone heads or phone addicts.
Furthermore, the more people use Facebook, the more jealousy they get.
It is obvious that people are naturally inclined to engage in social comparison.
For more details, with just a glance at the New Feeds, people can updates from their social cycles;
when people see someone who has a happier or more successful life then theirs, such as a new fancy car or an expensive beautiful dress, not only can Facebook make them feel like they are not sharing in their friends’s happiness and success, but it can also make them feel envious of their friends’s wonderful life.
As these negative social comparisons happen and accumulate day in day out, human being will definitely get extremely depressed and anxious leading to the antisocial and autism syndromes that can cause a lot of serious consequences, especially the suicide.
Facebook can be awesomely good for humankind if they exploit it properly, and it can also precipitate extremely serious and unpredictable consequences if people excessively abuse and improperly employ it.
We all know that natural disasters happen all over the world, and they can be utterly devastating for people’s lives and the environments we live in.
There are many different natural causes leading to natural disasters, and being aware of these causes enables us to be better prepared when they do arrive.
Earthquakes are another common natural disaster on the list that can cause many fatalities.
Earthquakes are caused by the movements of the plates in the earth’s crust.
These plates do not always move smoothly and can get stuck, and then cause a build-up of pressure – the reason why earthquake occur.
In addition to this, an earthquake under the water can also cause a tsunami by pushing large volumes of water to the surface causing great waves.
Tsunamis can also be caused by underwater volcanic eruptions which are another natural disaster caused by magma escaping from inside the earth.
An explosion takes place, releasing the magma from a confined space, and that is why huge quantities of gas and dust are always released during a volcanic eruption.
Inside of the volcano, the magma travels up and then pours out over the surrounding area as lava.
Last but not least, one of the most common natural disasters that we commonly forgot is wildfires.
They take place in many different countries all over the world, particularly during the summertime, and can be caused by a range of different reasons.
Some of the things starting the wildfires can be totally natural, while others can be manmade, but the speed they spread is entirely down to nature.
There are two main natural causes of wildfires which are the sun’s heat and lightning strikes.
Other reasons are campfires, smoking, fireworks and many other things caused by humans.
The reasons why they spread so quickly are prolonged hot, dry weather, where the vegetation dries out, which is why they often take place in woodland.
A huge portion of my early childhood memories is rather patchy and fuzzy where I barely recall the names and faces of my kindergarten teachers or classmates.
But the only thing that still stayed on with me from that period was the stories by Enid Blyton.
I could proudly say that I grew up with Blyton’s characters who accompanied me from my adolescence years well into my mid-elementary school years because her stories had varying levels of difficulty that catered to a wide group of readers.
For myself, this author opened up my young impressionable mind to different worlds, worlds that were magical and also culturally different.
For example, boarding schools are not common options in Singapore because for a tiny island like ours, my elementary school was only a 15-minute walk away from home.
Yet through the Malory Towers series, I knew more about how other children lived in other areas of the world.
As compared to watching cartoon, her stories left children much more room for imagination and creative thinking.
I conjured images about how Moon-face and Saucepan Man from the Faraway Tree series might look like and what color would an elf’s clothes be.
In my mind, elves were never as raggedy as Dobby in Harry Potter or as suave as Legolas in Lord of The Rings.
Instead, they were diminutive in stature, slender with sharp ears and friendly almond eyes wearing grey clothes.
After more than a decade of outgrowing Blyton’s books, I am deeply and truely impressed that she was able to articulate thoughts suitable for a child.
Being an author or writer, it is imperative to write in a way clearly understood by the readers.
As such, children authors need to simplify their thoughts and articulate using grammar and vocabulary appropriate for different age groups.
As an adult, one could imagine the difficulties to be a children’s author, much less a successful and timeless one for requires us to stop thinking like a grown-up and adopt the children’s psyche.
The Earth is very old.
It has changed often during its long life, and it is still changing.
Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex were alive, the Earth was much warmer.
There was very little ice on the land or on the sea, even in the very north or the very south of the world.
And the sea was much higher than it is today.
There have been many changes since that time, sometimes to a warmer climate, sometimes to a colder one.
About 20,000 years ago, for example, a time called an Ice Age began.
There was ice over much of the world, and it was 3 kilometres deep over much of North America and Europe.
And the sea was not as high as it is today.
Our climate has changed many times, and it will change again.
But now, for the very first time, people are changing the climate.
In the year 1900, the Earth was 0.
7 C colder than it was in 2000, just one hundred years later.
This change did not happen because of the Earth’s orbit – it happened because of us.
Some people think that this is a small change.
But think about this.
A change of just 5 to 7 C can start or finish an Ice Age.
Can the climate change like this?
Scientists think that it can – but not as quickly as this.
Scientists do not always agree.
Some think that the climate is changing a lot, and some think that it is changing a little.
Some think that it will change quickly, and some slowly.
But all scientists agree that climate change is happening.
The important question is this: how dangerous will the change be?
Al Gore, who worked next to President Clinton of the USA between 1993 and 2001, thinks that the change will be dangerous.
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore describes how the Earth’s climate has changed.
He has talked about the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years, but is he right?
Is climate change a dangerous problem?
Must we do something about it?
And what can we do?
One out of every two marriages nowadays ends in divorce and lots of divorcing families include children.
Parents who are obtaining a divorce are usually worried about the impact the divorce will have on their children.
During this difficult period, parents may be absorbed with their own problems, but continue to be the most important people in their children’s lives.
While parents may be ravaged or relieved by the divorce, children are constantly frightened and confused by the threat to their security.
Some parents feel so overwhelmed or hurt by the divorce that they may turn to the child for direction or comfort.
Divorce could be misinterpreted by children unless parents tell them what is happening, how they are involved and not involved, and what will happen to them.
Talking to children about a divorce is difficult.
The following tips can help both the young and the old with the challenge and stress of these conversations:Don’t keep it a secret or wait until the last minute.
Tell your child together with your spouse.
Keep things simple and straight-forward.
Inform them the divorce is not their fault.
Admit that this will be upsetting and sad for everyone.
Reassure your child that you both still love them and will be their parents forever.
Do not discuss each other’s faults or problems with the child.
Children will do best if they know that their mother and father will still be their parents and remain involved with them even though the marriage is ending and the parents won’t live together.
Pressure on a child to "choose" sides or long custody disputes can be particularly harmful for the youngster and can add to the damage of the divorce.
Research indicates that children do best when parents can cooperate on behalf of the child.
Parents’ ongoing commitment to the child’s well-being is vital.
If a child shows signs of distress, the family doctor or pediatrician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment.
In addition, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can meet with the parents to help them learn how to make the strain of the divorce easier on the entire family.
Psychotherapy for the children of a divorce, and the divorcing parents, can be helpful.
Vietnam is a tropical country located in Southeast Asia – the center of the world sea-route.
The tropical monsoon climate gives Vietnam resource-rich biological diversity.
Besides, Vietnam has S shape with 3620 kilometers of the coast with abundant tourism and seafood potentialities.
Vietnam has a long-lasting history with over four thousand years through the ups and downs of history and politics.
There are 54 ethnic groups in total and the Kinh is the largest one.
All the ethnic groups all over the country live peacefully under a common roof – Vietnam.
Vietnam is a country with special cultures, one of which is the Tet holiday.
From the first Dynasty of Vietnam (the Hung King Dynasty), our ancestors celebrated Tet Holiday every year.
Tet is the biggest holiday in Vietnam, which is held according to the Lunar Calendar.
Vietnamese people are friendly, intelligent, hard-working and thirsty for moving up.
You might think that Vietnam is a small country, but we never step back.
Far back in history, we proved it.
Throughout the ups and downs of history, we have defeated a lot of strong enemies from different lands.
In the wartime, both the French and the USA army became our defeaters.
Nowadays, we are building our country to become richer, more beautiful as the strong wish from Mr.Ho Chi Minh.
The MOONCAKE is a traditional Chinese pastry which is enjoyed during the annual Mid-Autumn festival by many people around the world.
The name "mooncake" comes from this festival, since families gather to celebrate this lunar festival and watch the full moon.
MOONCAKES are also an iconic Chinese dessert with a colorful history dating back thousands of years.
MOONCAKES are baked into round shapes, but varies in sizes and the varied ingredients based on different areas’ interpretation.
It is commonly made with a thin crust, thick sweet filling from lotus seed paste, and contains two yolks from salted duck eggs.
The round duck egg yolks perform the full moon.
The top layer of the mooncake includes symbols of the moon festival imprinted on them or is also decorated to have good luck characters.
The Mid-Autumn festival is considered as the second most important holiday in China after the Lunar New Year.
The annual festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month on the lunar calendar.
The origins of this festival dates back to Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE) where farmers celebrate the harvest of the crops and express thanks to the Mountain Gods.
The MOONCAKE became the offering as the public worshiped the moon during every autumn’s lunar.
There are also a great number of legends and folktales associated with the origins of moon cakes which have circulated.
Another importance is the shape of the moon as well as mooncake.
Thus, the round mooncake is not only a delicacy and dessert enjoyed, but it emphasizes the special importance that Chinese people attach to family reunion.
Police is not just the principle executor of the laws but also the primary keeper of peace and order.
Its functions include enforcing the laws, enacted by the legislature as well as the decisions of the court, besides, of course, preventing crime.
Police officers have a lot of authority in society and they are very important people for enforcing the law and ensuring the safety.
Police officer is an official employee of the police force.
"Police officers help to prevent crime and disorder, and uphold the law".
A decision to become a police officer is not an easy one.
Not only because it involves a lot of risky and dangerous situations, but because it puts a great responsibility on you.
Being a police officer is not just a job, even though you have salary.
You definitely have to think hard before you take a decision.
It’s well known that many young people’s police officer’s carriers end soon after they get started.
"When young men and women begin their law enforcement careers as police officers, they have no idea just how many pitfalls lay before them. Too many new police officers listen to bad advice, and they develop bad working habits".
Moreover, to become a police officer you have to meet a number of essentially important requirements which are, for example, to be physically available for those kinds of activities that being a police force employee must perform.
All your abilities and skills are thoroughly checked, since your level of competence and the quality of your performance will probably result in human life rescuing.
If thinking about future prospects, "employment of police is expected to increase about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2020. This is because people are concerned about crime and safety".
And probably, that’s a change for the better.
The summer before my junior year in high school, my family and I took a trip to a completely new world.
Being from a small town, I had never really been exposed to the elements of a large city such as New York City.
My trip there was like discovering an entirely new way of life that I had only heard stories of previously.
For about the tenth time the morning of the flight, I checked my room to make sure I didn’t leave anything essential behind.
My stomach was doing flips as we arrived at the airport and made our way to the gate.
It didn’t get much better than this: I watched through the window as the runway zoomed by and the buildings and houses became smaller and smaller as the plane gained altitude.
An exhilarating feeling overcame me as I realized that I would soon be in one of the most amazing cities of the United States.
As we stood waiting for a taxi outside of the airport, it was immediately apparent to me that New York City was not the same as New Caney, Texas.
It seemed like everyone there was in a hurry to get to another place.
The loud and constant sound of cars honking was heard throughout the entire trip.
As soon as a car seemed to be going slower than the person behind him liked, he would hear the horn of that car to let him know that he was apparently holding everybody else up!
When we found our hotel in Times Square, I noticed that it wasn’t just the cars that were in a hurry.
Everyone in the streets was walking at a brisk pace that indicated a rush to be somewhere.
The transportation of the city was also far different than anything that I had ever been exposed to.
In my little town, a bike, a car, or even walking was perfectly suitable for getting around town, but in this foreign land, there were many more ways for one to get to another destination.
Everywhere you looked, there were people hailing taxis, waiting on buses, rushing underground to the subway stations, walking frantically, or desperately trying to maneuver their own cars through the busy streets.
Just standing and watching the many people rushing their own separate ways was an interesting observation.
In addition to the people and transportation, the buildings were also an incredible sight.
Each street was crammed with buildings that were built side by side with no room in between them, and a number of skyscrapers were present throughout the city as well.
I was awestruck again as we went inside some of these buildings such as the Empire State Building and made our way towards the top.
Standing outside of one of the top stories of the Empire State Building was awesome.
I could hold the entire city in my hand from this view.
I could even see Ellis Island a distance away from there.
The stores were also large compared to the ones of my little town.
A small retail store in New Caney would be a huge store that took up an entire building in New York.
This would make it seem logical that the prices of everything in New York were almost triple those back home.
It was as if the little peaceful neighborhood where I lived was magnified by 100 to make up the wonder city of New York.
My visit to New York City was a life changing experience.
For the first time in my life, I was exposed to a little taste of what the real world is like.
The incredible modes of transportation, the huge skyscrapers, and all of the thousands of people made me anxious to grow up and perhaps move to an incredible city such as this one.
Either way, my first trip to New York was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, one I will always treasure.
FAMILYI cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side.
Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted.
Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.
Whether it’s my grandparent, my two sisters, my mom, or my dad, I know I can always count on someone to help me feel better.
In fact, I think that this is probably the most important thing that my family has taught me;
a family is made up of people who you can trust and who you can count on.
Too many times today, we read in the papers about families where parents abuse their children, verbally and physically.
What these parents don’t realize is that they are either beginning or involving themselves in a vicious circle of hate in families.
When parents abuse their children, they are telling their children that that is the way to raise children, and this is what their children learn.
I was lucky, I have learned differently, because my family cares about me, and I care about them.
In this world of doubt, insecurity, and fear, my family is always there for me, holding their arms open to me with love.
On the first day of first grade, I didn’t want to go to school, I had butterflies in my stomach and I found it difficult to walk because I was so nervous.
The only reason that I finally went into the classroom is because my mom walked in with me, and promised me that as soon as school was out, she’d be there waiting for me, ready to bring me back to where I felt most comfortable, my family.
Luckily, I’m a little more grown up now;
I can go into school by myself, and in a couple of years, when I go away to college, I’ll really have to go to school by myself.
Of course I know I’ll make friends, but none of them will mean as much to me as my family.
It seems like every parent wants their kid to grow up to be a doctor.
but, maybe you really want to!
Being a doctor is all about helping sick people get healthy, and if this sounds like something you want to do, then find out what it takes to follow your dream!
As you know, If you have the flu, you go see the doctor.
If you break your leg from falling down the stairs, you go see the doctor.
If you get sick with something serious like mono or the measles, you go see the doctor.
As you can see, medical doctors do a lot more then wear white coats and carry around stethoscopes.
They help sick people by figuring out what’s wrong with them and giving them the right medicine to get better.
Forget Superman or Spider-Man or any of those other superheroes – doctors are the real heroes cuz they’re the ones who save people’s lives!
Nothing is more rewarding than that.
Most doctors may have to work on evenings and weekends too, and be on call.
That means you have to wear a pager 24/7 and if you get paged, you’ll have to go into work, even if it’s your birthday or a holiday, cuz a sick person needs your help.
Oh, and that’s another downside – you’re always around sick people, which can be pretty depressing.
During my visit to Da Lat last year, I quickly realised why Da Lat was often referred to as a small version of the Netherlands.
The narrow streets there were always filled with blossoming and colorful flowers.
As the locals were preparing for the Flower Festival, most of the streets were decorated with "umbrella inflorescences" made from umbrellas and a lot of bright lights.
These Umbrella inflorescences would be hung next to each other at varying heights ranging from 7 to 9 meters.
In the day time, these umbrellas looked like flowers and at night.
they glowed like splendid flower lanterns.
Both sides of the street had small vendor booths with coffee, tea, wine and street drawings for tourists to enjoy.
Everyday, people would enjoy a street parade with thousands of decorated flowers on various items.
On a vehicle, dancers would wear floral dresses and throw petals to nearby passengers.
Leisurely walking down the street while enjoying all of the colors and smells that thousands of flowers shared with me was my daily activity while I was in Da Lat.
But if you were looking for something more exciting, there were also dozens of exhibitions and trade shows full of flowers, food and drinks, all available for you to explore and enjoy.
I chose to visit the Flowers Market and Food by Flowers festival.
Food made from flowers in Da Lat was not only unique in taste but also was presented in magnificent ways.
I didn’t know that there were so many edible flowers that tasted so great.
I was amazed at how these skillful chefs were able to preserve the original scents and flavors of the flowers after cooking.
every dish looked like a little masterpiece.
Da Lat was also a perfect place for couples on their honeymoon vacation.
They could visit the flower villages in Ha Dong, Thai Phien or Van Thanh, each village would bring them an unique experience.
Ha Dong flower villages still preserved the traditional method of gardening from seedlings with natural fertilizing and harvesting.
while Thai Phien flower village looked like a small industrial zone with sparkling glass houses.
During honeymoon vacation, they could also visit the House of Love, a special flower garden in the Love Valley as well as take a trip to the Immortal Flower Hill in Lament Lake or Gold Flower Hill in Golden Valley.
The temperature in Da Lat was always around 20 degrees Celsius and the weather was often foggy.
The subtle scent of thousands of flowers created a beautiful atmosphere for honeymooners.
Colorful paintings with hundreds of blossoms throughout the area created a romantic look that was indescribable.
The Da Lat flower festival closing ceremony was situated next to Xuan Huong Lake.
There were thousands of visitors that participated in an exciting street dance with nearly 4000 liters of wine served while I was there.
The Wine festival was a feast specially designed to say good-bye to visitors traveling to Da Lat for the flower festival in this mountainous region of Vietnam.
It was an experience I would never forget.
Many years ago, when I was a little child, I admired adventures.
I think that since I breathed in for the first time and felt the ground underneath my feet, when for the very first time I looked at the night sky and its numerous eyes, I wished to live the life of an adventurer.
To explore the jungles, to stride the dessert, to wander through the lost cities and to dive into the deep darkness of the ocean I find extremely exciting.
My wish is to be an adventurer.
To be an adventurer you need some qualities.
You need to know how to get out of some risky and dangerous situations.
You need to know how to survive.
It would also be suggested to know how to sail, because a good sailor is a good adventurer.
What is more, the most epic adventures are found on the sea.
The best thing about going on an adventure is that it is really exciting, filled with thrill and danger.
And, I know it is some kind of cliche, but danger is my middle name.
Another good thing about adventure is the sights you see, the beautiful forests, and the castles.
so many wonderful castles that have numerous ancient tales about knights and dragons.
But like every human has his disadvantages, going on adventures has its bad sides too.
In all the danger and thrill, many have lost their lives.
And so ‘through the darkness and night a beam of light appears and the Dovahkiin comes,’ as the legend says.
One day, a man shall appear and repel all the evil, he will kill all the foes of his land.
But more importantly, he will win, he will conquer all the obstacles and get to his goal.
And, by following his steps, I will become an adventurer for sure.
my mother.
Do you have someone who is great, spends time with you, cares for you, and is an important person?
Well, I do!
she has black hair, brown eyes, and a caring touch.
That’s my mom.
My mom talks to me about many things.
One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up.
She tells me what to do in case of an emergency.
And one day I had a really bad day with my friends, and she told me what to do about it.
My mom and I spend a lot of time together.
We play games, bake cookies, make necklaces, and draw doodle tricks.
But our favorite thing to do is read.
Our favorite book is "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie".
Mom takes me shopping at the mall.
We buy toys and clothes, and we eat at the café.
We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonald’s restaurant.
When we ride the escalator, my mom pretends to fall back and says, "My shoestring’s stuck!".
My mom always laughs, and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy!
She doesn’t laugh every day, but when she does, it’s hilarious, and I have to laugh, too!
My mom is the greatest.
I love how she jokes around.
She is always fun no matter what.
She gives me great advice.
My mom is more than a mom, she is like my best friend!
My hobby is collecting books.
I collect books whenever I have more need for some books.
I collect many kinds of books such a love story books or textbooks I am learning at school, you know, Maths, History, Geography, Biology.
and books about nature.
I buy books from a bookshop near my house, and some other stores.
I also get books from my friends.
I collect books because I would like to learn from books.
They help me broaden my knowledge.
In the future, I try to make my collection larger.
I would open a book store of my own.
This essay on book collecting is intended for potential book collectors and neophytes to this field of collecting and it will likely prove boring to those who are established book collectors and probably to some who are not.
Our intention is to acquaint you with this interesting hobby, to explain the terminology or jargon, and to dispel a few myths or misconceptions.
You can collect in any of a mind-boggling number of areas — this hobby has more variety within it than any other collecting field we can imagine.
You can collect your favorite author.
an author you always wanted-to-read, but- never-had-the-time.
a subject about which you wish to learn more — the American Indian, or the American Indian of the 19th century, or the Blackfoot Tribe or the agriculture of the Algonquins — you can collect recent in-print books, books from the 19th century, books from the first century of printing, paperback books, pulp magazines, fine leather bindings, historic newspapers, pamphlets from the period of the American Revolution or the French Revolution or Vietnam, books printed on mission presses in the Pacific, or even books about book collecting!
Book collecting is expensive!
Not true!
You can spend as little or as much as you are able and willing to spend on your collection.
Some collectors purchase only new in-print books, others buy only at yard sales and library book sales, others visit their neighborhood used book shop, others order only from mail order antiquarian book catalogs, and many are now buying books on the world wide web.
If you are very limited in discretionary funding or very frugal, you could even hold yourself to a maximum of $1.00 (US or the equivalent) per volume by buying at flea markets and yard sales and slowly build an interesting and potentially valuable collection.
Hoi An is an ancient town down the Thu Bon River, on the coastal plain of Quang Nam Province, for about 30 km south of Da Nang City.
Hoi An used to be known as the international market with many different names such as Lam Ap, Faifo, Hoai Pho and Hoi An is the most common one now.
What is special about Hoi An is that this little port town is in an incredible state of preservation.
It includes some of the most densely-concentrated sights in Viet Nam with its old streets which are bordered with ancient houses and assembly halls, its pagodas, temples, ancient wells and tombs.
In total, there are more than a thousand places of interest.
The architecture in Hoi An is characterized by a harmonious blend of Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese culture.
After many centuries, Hoi An is still respectful of its traditions, folk festivals, beliefs and of its sophisticated culinary art.
Located in a quiet environment, Hoi An is surrounded by peaceful villages famous for crafts such as carpentry, bronze making, ceramic.
Researchers said that most of the buildings in Hoi An underwent restoration at the beginning of the 19th century, even if some of them might be constructed long time ago.
The ancient architecture is shown most clearly in the Ancient Town that is located in Minh An Ward.
It covers about 2 square kilometers and almost of all famous relics in Hoi An are gathered here.
The streets are very short and narrow, having a winding, crossing as the chessboard style.
The topography of the ancient town tilt gradually from north to south.
The buildings in the old town are built mostly with traditional materials such as.
brick, wood and no more than two floors.
The trace of time is able to find not only on the architectural design of each building but also everywhere like.
on the yin-yang roof tiles covered with moss and plants.
the old gray mold walls.
the pictures carved on a strange animal, or describing an old story.
Having inherited a multi-cultural architecture which is so varied and sophisticated, Hoi An must have attracted numerous and talented workers in carpentry, ceramics, and woodcarving from China, Japan and other regions of Viet Nam.
For centuries, Hoi An had developed into a melting pot of various nationalities who came to the area, and brought along their own cultures.
Accordingly, Hoi An features the co-existence of indigenous customs and habits and those imported by foreign settlers.
Essay on my trip to Nha Trang cityMy first visit to Nha Trang, a coastal city in Vietnam, was three years ago.
It was a pleasant and memorable trip.
Nha Trang, the Capital of Khanh Hoa province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam.
In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so attractive.
Waves crashing onto the cliffs.
the soft sigh of the sea breeze.
clean white sands and turquoise waters.
it all makes for a marvelous landscapes.
It’s no accident that Nha Trang is often compared to a Mediterranean City.
During my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach – a chance of breathing in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water.
One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands.
Hon Tre is the largest among the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys.
Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests.
Tri Nguyen island is the location of an outdoor aquarium housing more than 400 species of fish, crustaceans and other marine life.
That trip, I spent the whole day roaming the Ponaga Cham towers.
These ancient Hindu temples were built from the 7th to 12th century.
Many of the sandstone statues from this time still remain among the red brick towers, typical of Cham architecture.
Nha Trang is the city in harmony.
its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a certain balance.
Nha Trang is a perfect tourist destination.
As I left, I was reminded of one reason I like the place so much.
I hope to have chance to come back.
I love listening to music, but I am not like other people who often listen to the music that is popular at a time.
The part of music that attracts me is the attitude of the composers and the tone, because the songs represent the writers’ mood and feeling.
Through the songs people can feel what the composers try to express, so I often listen to Jazz, Rock, and R&B.
These three types of music contain different languages but they are all my favorite music styles.
When I really want to relax my body, or to do the exercises at home I will listen to Jazz music.
I do not have the exact time to do exercises, I just play it to release my body.
Jazz music is much faster and more relaxing than pop music.
It makes me want to dance, to do any kind of motion to let go of my body while the music is on.
Sometimes I prefer to do it on my bed.
It is healthy for my body.
My second favorite music style is Rock, which I listen to when I am in a bad mood or lonely.
Rock is very different from Jazz because Rock is quite noisy and contains a lot of screaming.
But the tone of the songs is like magic that can flush all my unhappiness, even though those things are still right there, but at the moment I can feel I have strength to solve problems, and I am not scared of anything anymore.
When I have something to face or have to make a choice, I always listen to Rock music, let the music go through my mind so that I can think deeper and deeper.
I often just sit on the chair and do nothing.
This happened when I am quite tired or sleepy.
for example, sitting on the MRT or buses, I do not think or do anything.
I do not like to be disturbed by others, I want to have my own space.
And R&B music can help me get away from my busy life and clean up my soul.
The three types of music have different functions for me, however, they all bring me happiness and help me get through difficult time.
Hobby is the favourite work or choice which borns spontaneously from inside of a person.
It is very natural and unbiased from external influence.
It attracts us with such an intensity as weleave other more important tasks.
It make us obsessive to become besotted towards our hobby.
Hobby is that which provide peace, happiness and ultimate satisfaction in our life.
Hobbyists should be careful to do their hobby related work in their leisure time only.
Otherwise it would be a murderous to darken one’s fate.
Therefore my suggestion is thatone must be able to judge the value of time in various phases of life.
It has been noticed that a student destroyed his carrier by devoting fully on his hobby of Guitar playing.
Our like and dislike don’treflect our strength or weakness.
There must be a fine balance between our lifestyle and performance.
Music listening is my hobby.
Music is a common name that has encapsulated various kind of songs e.g.
patriotic song, religious, classical music.
The list is endless.
My mother says, when I was at the age of seven years, I was more interested to listen songs.
Also I showed reflection of singing ability in those days.
Still at this age it fits to my nature.
I love to listen songs because I feel a sense of accomplishment.
I can isolate myself from the crowd and I can pass my time with full entertainment.
It gives me new energy.
It reduces my stresses.
While listening music, I feel out of world.
I seldom hesitate to spend for my hobby.
In past time it was a dream to have a good quality music system for me.
On that time l prmished myself to buy a costly music system when I would get money.
Almighty listened my wish and now I am blessed with such a level of earning that I can buy any music system to quench thirst of my hobby.
Before Tet, people should return all the things that they have borrowed from others and pay all the debts they owed.
It is believed that people should never start a new year with debts and borrowed things.
otherwise in that year people would be stuck with debts.
On the first day of Tet, adults (those who have already got married and have income) are supposed to prepare some "lucky money" to give the children and kids when visiting other’s homes as a symbol of luck for the coming New Year.
People are also supposed to say best wishes to others.
These activities are done with the expectation that luck and good things are brought to everyone.
Gift-exchanging is another common custom during Tet holiday, which is used mostly in business.
The process of giving and receiving gifts help to enhance the relationships between clients and firms.
The popular presents are cookies, chocolates, fruit baskets, wine, soft drinks or other kinds of treats.
Usually, people can buy a pack of gifts in the shops which includes many different kinds of food.
If you have a Vietnamese business partner, take this opportunity to enhance the relationships.
Tet is a special occasion that people wear new and beautiful outfits.
The streets during Tet is full with colorful dresses, ao dai and other costumes.
It is thought that colorful bright colors like red, yellow or blue can bring good luck and prosperity to people for the upcoming year.
Another essential element of Tet is smiles.
A smile can make everything seem more relaxing and enhance relationship among people.
A smile can bring joy and happiness to you as well as people around you for the whole year also.
During this Tet, people refrain themselves from getting angry or depressed and put an instant smile on their faces, hoping for a happy new year.
Technology is now a big part of our society and our predictable future.
There is little room for people who wish to live without technology, and luckily, it is still advancing at a rate that has helped stave off stagnation.
I believe that for every advantage that technology brings us, it also brings us a disadvantage at the same time.
Smartphones enable people to stay in touch, even over long distances, and they are relatively safe and reliable to use.
There are devices that people can use to communicate with plus at the other end of the planet and getting and keeping in touch with other people is very easy.
The disadvantages of smartphone is that it means people no longer need to meet in person as much, and interpersonal relationships are suffering worldwide because people are communicating through a small handheld device.
A lot of people have smartphones and they use them almost semi-continuously, including in public settings when they could be making new friends, finding new lovers, and interacting with their current friends.
The advantages of the internet are that people can communicate over vast distances and can gain access to information and get answers to their questions very quickly.
The disadvantage is that the Internet isn’t moderated in the way that people think and lots of it is filled with misinformation and outright lies.
Even brand-named websites which have a lot of trust are not accountable for what appears on their own websites.
Even respected and branded news sites have stories that have passed through many people’s hands and originally started as lies with zero accountability throughout the dissemination process.
In conclusion, technology brings about such a lot of advantages.
However, it’s people’s duty to use it in an appropriate way to make it beneficial.
The job that I have is also the same as the job that I have always wanted to have.
I’m an English teacher, and I also run a website called DailyStep.
com, so that I can teach English to many more people than I could teach in one classroom.
Different aspects of my job involve different skills.
When it comes to teaching, the job involves, of course, teaching students for general and business English, and so on.
This requires a detailed knowledge of grammar, syntax, business skills such as presentations and meetings and more.
The website side involves other skills, many of which I have had to acquire as I went along.
I have to write dialogues for lessons, produce blogs, answer emails, record audio files, maintain the content on the website, and liaise with technical developers on website improvements I have suggested.
Of course, I also have to deal with day to day problems as they arise.
I chose the job of English teacher after several years working as a researcher and journalist, as English is my first love and my passion.
I really enjoy explaining things in a concise and clear way too.
When I was a child, I used to like games such as organizing words into categories, and I think perhaps the kick I get from explaining grammar well is an extension of that.
I’m interested in this job for so many reasons.
As I mentioned, I love the English language.
I am also fascinated to learn about people and their life stories, and in this job I meet a huge variety of people from all over the world.
I’m keen to help bridge the divides between cultures.
when people speak a common language, and can communicate, then perhaps they can start to understand each other better in other ways too.

Do you know that many countries without electricity power?
In Viet Nam, the people in remote mountains as Ha Giang, Lang Son province.
have used oil lamp instead of electricity power.

In the future I want to become a fashion designer.
My goal is to create clothes for all sizes, ages, and genders.
In my clothing I want to show a creative side of my artistic ability and I want to make my clothing affordable for all as well.
I think I want to become a fashion designer because I have a passion for art.
I enjoy making sketches of clothing that I hope one day will be available in stores all over the world.
Fashion designing, to me, is a way to express the unique side of your creativity.
This is also a career that I believe I can achieve if I stay focused and continue to put effort in my creations.
I find interior designing as a possible career in my future since it’s somewhat similar to fashion designing.
Both involve having a sense of style and an eye for color, texture and pattern coordination.
In order to prepare for this career in my future I need to attend a college involving designing, fashion designing, and a type of art.
The qualification I would need would be a two to four-year college for fashion designing and a one to three-year college for interior designing.
These careers require a bachelor’s degree in some place of art.
So as to attend college, first of all I have to maintain an acceptable grade point average which is 2.5 or higher depending on the location of the college as well as the level of the skill learning of the college.
It is undoubtedly the case that cities around the world increasingly suffer from congestion.
In this essay, I will examine the reasons leading to this trend and suggest some practical policies the authorities could implement to reduce the level of traffic in our cities.
The first step is to understand why traffic has increased in cities.
Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons for this.
The third reason is that society has in general become more mobile and this means more people are prepared to commute to work by car than they were before.
There is almost certainly no one who can propose solution to this problem given the complexity of its causes.
However, one option has to be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take buses or the trains rather than get in their cars.
It would also be possible to discourage people from driving to work by introducing special tariffs for using the roads, especially during rush hours.
A successful example of this is the congestion charge scheme in London which has certainly reduced the level of traffic in inner-city areas.
In conclusion, there are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas.
While it may not be possible to find a complete solution, any action should probably involve encouraging greater use of public transport and making it more expensive for the motorist to drive in urban areas.
The job of a pilot is a very hard and risky, but prestigious one.
Pilots travel thousands of kilometers a day and they can find themselves in different time and climate zone.
They can see all parts of the world and get to know new people where they arrive.
But a pilot also faces some problems.
They often suffer from jet lag and can easily become tired when being in different time zones.
They have to spend many days away from home and their families.
Even though many people think it is a real dream job, pilots must be responsible for other people because they hold the lives of a few hundred passengers in their hands.
They are required to have hundreds of hours of training before that.
Pilots must remain calm in dangerous situations and always have to make the right decisions.
They also need to see and hear perfectly.
Many people believe that pilots are paid a lot of money.
It is true for pilots who work for a big airline company, smaller budget ones cannot afford to pay their pilots that much.
In today’s world, airlines are competing fiercely for their market shares.
As a result, pilots may lose their jobs if airlines decide to cut costs.
Sharing is a good way of living in modern society.
Sharing, literally, means showing concerns and empathy towards other people.
.
The sharing is expressed in many ways, which can be very small actions such as encouragement, comforting words, holding hands or loving eyes.
sharing has a very important role in life.
No one lives without the sharing of others.
Life is always full of difficulties and no one knows what to expect.
Sometimes, we need to share so that we can get motivation to move on.
The sharing is not a figurative thing.
Sometimes, just a small action is enough.
Sharing is not difficult, all it needs is an act from the bottom of your heart.
What will you get in return for you share?
The answer is love.
If you want to receive, firstly, you have to learn how to give and to share.
Life not only has material value but also needs sincere feelings.
sharing and empathy will bring you wonderful things and make your life better.
People often say "the coldest place is not the North Pole, but the place where there is no love." Life is giving and receiving.
So, why not give love to receive love back?
In my freetime, I like to dance.
I know that for some people dancing is not considered a true hobby.
but the way I see it, if I enjoy dancing and spend my precious time doing it, then I have every right to consider it as my special hobby.
Dancing was just my thing.
As far as I can remember about my childhood, right after I learned to walk, I have always loved to dance and I began to dance around the house all the time.
My mom put me in dance school when I was three years old.
I would learn so quickly that the instructor would sometimes ask me to help her teach the other students.
My first dance show was at school festival when I was five years old.
Becoming a famous dancer was one of my greatest childhood dreams.
It is hard to define the actual start of dancing.
Dancing has been around for too long that people can’t remember.
Dancing is a category of art that is popular worldwide, streaming through every country in many forms.
Everyone can dance in their own way so it is easy to get started with this hobby.
Dancing requires both physical and mental tenacity.
This is difficult in the face of a highly competitive atmosphere and the pressures of a busy academic and social life.
However, my passion and love for it have made all of these struggles worth it.
Dancing was a hobby that I always will love.
My love of dance has always served as an inspiration for me.
I dance from my heart and always strive to do my best.
My father is a lovely father of the world.
He is my real hero, my best friend, my inspiration in my life.
He is the person who helps me a lot in getting prepared for the school, getting rise of the bed and having my homework done well.
He always cares for me and calls my mom in the afternoon just to know that whether I arrive home from school at right time or not.
He is very healthy, fit, happy, peaceful and punctual person.
He always goes to the office on time and also teaches us to go to school at right time.
He teaches us the value of time in life and says that if one wastes his or her time, time ruins his or her life.
He is a very nice person and helps my neighbors in their difficult time.
He always loves, cares and respects my mom and never quarrels with her.
He always supports her and sometimes, he helps in the kitchen during her illness.
He respects and loves my grandparents and teaches us to take care of them.
He tells us that old people are like God for us, we should care, love and respect them.
We should never avoid the old in their difficult time as this time comes in everyone’s life once.
He tells us that we should always help needy people of any age group all through the life according to our status.
He takes 15 minutes of us every day to tell us about the ethics and other good habits.
Every teacher devotes all his or her life to education.
It usually isn’t because of the money or the three-month summer vacation.
Reasons for becoming a teacher are deeper than that, and while they are personal, they are almost all united by the desire to impact peoples’ lives.
One reason to become a teacher is to influence the education system.
If you recognize the need to improve the quality of education in your country, then you may become a teacher to make change.
There is a lot of work to be done, but it is the collective effort of thousands of dedicated teachers that will make the most difference.
Another reason for becoming a teacher is to make contribution to your community in a meaningful way.
Teaching is one of the most direct ways to make an impact, and if you are driven by the desire to help people around you, being a teacher is an invaluable contribution.
Teachers do more than teaching, and their impact extends far beyond the classroom.
As a teacher, you are more than just an educator because you are a mentor, a confidant and a friend.
One of the most common reasons to become a teacher is to make a difference in the lives of as many students as possible.
Teachers have more chances to interact with students at all stages of development and from all walks of life.
A great teacher always wants to help students along their path and to play a part in shaping the person they hope to become.
Becoming a teacher lets you impart life lessons that they will never forget and puts you in a position to influence their decisions, behaviors, strengths, weaknesses and imaginations.
Essentially, becoming a teacher lets you take part in shaping the next generation.
What’s your hobby?
Reading books, listening to music, shopping.
or feeding cats like me.
The biggest hobby I like is feeding cats.
I guess that many people will have this hobby like me, especially girls.
Cats are dutiful, cute and very easy to feed.
Since I was 10, I have been interested in having a cat, and my father gave me a white cat as a gift to celebrate the 11th birthday.
I cried so much, because of happiness, and I promised that I will take care of him carefully.
And now, I’m 18 years old, I still raise this cat.
Every day in the morning, I usually feed him, and then I go to school, and he stays at home.
In the afternoon, I take him for a walk with my mother.
About 2 – 3 days, I just take him to have a bath, because, he is scared of water.
In the winter, I really like to buy clothing for my cat to make him warm, and this is the best thing I like.
Next time, I prepare to have a lady cat from my grandma, so I feel happy and look forward to this moment.
And you, do you love cats like me?
Mountains always have a great fascination for men and people, particularly the rich go to the mountains to escape from the noise of the life below.
Mountain climbing, however, is not without risks.
It is a challenge to the unconquerable spirit of a man and his love of adventure.
That this is a dangerous sport cannot be denied.
When one climbs higher and higher, breathing becomes more and more difficult.
Some climbers, therefore, carry a heavy apparatus on their back from which they inhale oxygen.
Mountain climbing is extremely dangerous.
There are snow storms and blizzards.
It is troublesome to walk through the snow.
It is still more difficult to climb on ice because it is hard to keep foothold and cut steps with axes so as to make progress.
The cold is so severe that the climber’s feet, toes and fingers may suffer from frostbite.
The most serious difficulty is that the climber at a high altitude gets exhausted with a little effort.
Mountain climbing requires proper training, skill and knowledge.
The climbers must be well equipped.
They must be in good physical condition and should have courage, perseverance and power of endurance.
They should carry with them maps, compasses and other equipment in order that they are able to find out where they are in the absence of any, tracks.
The climbers take with them packs loaded with first-aid supplies, food and extra clothing for sudden changes of weather.
They display the spirit of sportsmanship and fellow-feeling and face the severe risks of life undaunted.
Mountain climbing is a thrilling but manly adventure.
It brings into playing the heroic qualities of man.
Mountaineers deserve all praise for their courage and heroism.
Ho Chi Minh City is one of the biggest cities in the south of Vietnam, which provides people with a great number of various jobs.
Therefore, people from many different parts of the country keep on moving to this city, hoping to find out their ‘paradise’.
For those who have been living in this city for a long time, more than 10 years for example, their ‘used-to-be paradise’ is getting worse and worse.
Its increasing crime and disorder also makes Ho Chi Minh City a worse place to live in today than ten years ago.
A number of the city dwellers, especially young illiterate guys of lower social classes, cannot earn their living legally.
They allow themselves to rob or steal anything they can to satisfy their needs, irrespective of how serious the consequences of their frightening acts are.
Pollution is the first thing that makes Ho chi Minh City a worse place to live in.
Its drainage system has been overbooked to drain for a city of over seven million people nowadays.
Consequently, the so-called ‘the pearl of the Far East’ is getting more and more polluted.
Water pollution is only part of the pollution facing all the dwellers of this biggest city in Vietnam.
The air pollution here is no less serious.
Thousands of factories are still located inside this city and keep on releasing poisonous smoke.
Various means of transportation, especially millions of motorcycles, do contribute to the ever-increasing air pollution in Ho Chi Minh city.
It is invariably true that every person who is knowledgeable leads a successful life.
Knowledge is very important tool to get positive changes in the society and country.
Knowledge helps us to absorb things from the genius people which have potential to improve the quality of life.
Knowledge is the only precious thing which nobody can take away from us.
It gives new and revolutionary ideas which help to alter the way of viewing the world.
So, we can say that knowledge is pillar to the success and happiness.
Knowledge helps us to convert our planning into the right action and enables to get the difference between right or wrong and good or bad.
It helps us to overcome our weaknesses and faults as well as makes us able to face the dangers and difficulties by giving lots of courage and confidence.
It makes a person more powerful by giving him mental, moral and spiritual advancement in the life.
Human beings are physically weaker than animals yet they have managed things for years to become the most powerful creature on earth.
Because they get power from knowledge and are independent on the physical strength.
Human beings are clever creature of nature, they have ability to acquire knowledge and preserve their knowledge, research and experiences in the books in order to pass to the new generations.
Knowledge gives them power to know how to control the forces of nature and then use them for getting benefited.
Knowledge is a most strong tool which cannot be defeated by other power on the earth.
Knowledge provides social power to person holding certain power over those people who do not.
Obtaining knowledge helps to address various difficulties in life.
Cats as pets have become far more familiar with mankind community, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations.
However, although problems regarding cats’ hair may affect the health conditions of people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally, are clearly undeniable.
In term of physical benefits, the well-being with cats are more favorable compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take after themselves, the responsibility to ensure their love one being fed and well taken care of makes them to become even more active.
Owing to these extra activities, this though might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad lifestyles.
Coupled with physical side, their mental aspect will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the feeling of loneliness.
Therefore, their depressing rate could be minimized.
Despite the above advantages, the threats of too close interaction between cats and vulnerable people still exist.
One of the major concerns is the harmfulness of their hairs on their owner, especially those with asthma.
Because of the virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets.
In addition, old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, because their health conditions are limited, which could become even more challenging when they try to take care of others.
In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic outweigh its shortages.
For these reasons, instead of discontinuing them, further support would be far more beneficial.
Nowadays, teamwork is an essential element of the society.
We all work with people everyday.
A co-worker is a person with whom we work closely and share tasks.
In my opinion, the important characteristics of a co-worker should be as followed.
First of all, an important character of a co-worker should be reliability.
As we often have to encounter a lot of problems at work, it is a good thing to work with someone that we can always count on.
A reliable co-worker can help us with problems that we cannot solve by ourselves.
Also, if we happen to be absent from work, a reliable co-worker can always backup what we have been working on and make correct decisions even without us.
Last of all, another important character of a co-worker should be responsibility.
Indeed, no one would want an irresponsible person as his or her co-worker.
It would be a nightmare if your co-worker does not do anything and leave everything for you to finish.
On the other hand, a responsible co-worker not only do his own part of work, but also, as soon he finishes his own, helps you finish yours, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the work.
A responsible co-worker can help others work more efficiently by giving others aid in addition to getting their part of job done.
To summarize, as I have stated above, a good co-worker should be reliable and responsible.
A co-worker that possesses these characteristics can certainly help enhance the progress of work and benefits his or her colleagues as well.
Violin is one of the rare instruments that you can learn at a very young age, as they make very small student versions, and so at the age of 10 I began to learn to play violin.
Learning violin was a lot of fun to me due to the great teachers in the class, and now that my parents knew that I needed to stay interested so as to keep progressing.
Following the traditional path, I started with group violin lessons rather than individual violin lessons.
I didn’t even start with a real violin.
we all had boxes that were wrapped in brown paper!
A ruler was taped to the end of the box to simulate a fingerboard, and our "bow" was the cardboard tube from a clothes hanger.
Therefore, my very first lessons on how to play violin were actually about how to stand, how to hold the violin, and how to make the proper movements in unison with the teacher and the other kids.
It didn’t take long for me to earn the privilege of unwrapping my box and receiving a real violin.
And soon my violin lessons, along with daily practice with my parents, became part of the family routine.
I know now that to learn to play violin, you need to be drawn to the sound of the violin.
You’re going to be hearing that sound a lot, so it’s very crucial to have some connection there from the start!
You will need someone who can show you proper setup at the beginning, since there are so many dead ends and blind alleys related to postures and positioning that are very hard to overcome without help.
And you also need someone around you who can motivate you and keep you accountable on a regular basis.
It’s best if this person is a violin teacher, someone who can assess your progress regularly.
Why learn to play violin instead of other instruments?
Because the violin is so versatile!
You can play alone, choosing among hundreds of years’ worth of solo repertoire from composers as diverse as Bach, Paganini, Bartok or John Adams.
You can play with a friend who has a piano, or with three in a string quartet.
You can also play in a string orchestra or a full orchestra.
And there are many more community orchestras than professional ones so that anybody that wants to play in a group has a chance.
The discipline and love of the violin sound will take you anywhere you want to go.
If you’ve been thinking about learning to play violin, don’t wait any longer!
Find a violin, get it a check-up, and get someone to show you the basis.
Then don’t let anything stand in your way.
Because of the deep penetration of the Internet across the world, it would indeed be a big problem if the ‘Internet plug’ was pulled out from our lives.
We have become dependent on the Internet for most of the things we want to do such as learning, shopping, socializing, or entertaining ourselves.
It has become a way of life for many of us.
In the absence of the Internet, the implications would be devastating.
The impact of having no Internet on your overall living style would depend upon how often you use it, and what you use it for.
If you were an Internet addict, you would find that your life has come to a screeching halt.
People use the Internet to stay connected to our friends and family.
If you had gotten very used to socializing online, you would now be clueless as to how you could share those pictures of your recent trip you went for, with your friends spread across the globe.
It would be difficult to meet and interact with people living outside your locality.
With no way to communicate using emails, instant messaging, chat, or social media, we would have to resort to those old ways of communicating with people.
We would have to resort to the option of a face-to-face interaction, telephone conversation, or sending and receiving snail mail.
The Internet has become a gigantic sea of information and resources.
No Internet would mean no instant and easy access to information at the click of a button.
You would have to walk down to your local library and actually search the whole place to get the information you are looking for, with little chances that you will find what you seek instantly.
Students who were in the habit of using the Internet for completing their assignments and projects will have a tough time figuring out an alternative.
To sum up, the Internet now plays an important role in our daily life.
If there were no its existence, you couldn’t read this example essay.
Playing sport is necessary because it brings about physical strength and mental power to the person involved in this on regular basis.
Outdoor sports such as football, cricket, volleyball, hockey, running, help in improving physical health and mental fitness.
However, some indoor games and sports like brain games, chess, Sudoku.
improve mental power and concentration level.
Sports and games are very beneficial to us as they teach us punctuality, patient, discipline, teamwork and dedication.
Being involved in the sports activities helps us in getting protected with numerous diseases such as arthritis, obesity, heart problems, diabetes.
It teaches us to go ahead in life by removing all the weaknesses.
It makes us bold and gives the feeling of happiness by reducing the occurrence of anxiety and angry.
My favourite subject in high school is English.
I not only want to become fluent in foreign language but also desire to deeply understand the beauty of this language.
In my opinion, English is one of the most powerful tools that exists nowadays to communicate to other people.
It makes easier to make friends around the world.
By using english, we can explore the world in a deeper way.
Thanks to this language, I can understand more about different cultures.
I am the kind of person who love traveling.
Therefore, it’s essential to master in English if you want to communicate to the local people.
In addition, you won’t feel lost in the middle of a city because you can ask the natives for help.
It was such an amazing method of communication when I travelled in Japan, French or Korea without knowing the local languages.
Furthermore, I believe that English helps a lot to get access to the latest information about scientific topics such as Economics, which by the way was my major at university.
If you want to be at the forefront in your professional field, nothing is better than reading the different articles.
Whilst, most of them are written in English.
In conclusion, I think that there are many reasons to learn English because of it’s benefits.
If you really fall in love with English, you will never want to give up it for any reasons.
Everyone always has expectation to be rich or to have his or her own company.
Some people dream of becoming leaders, politicians and famous stars.
There are others who are interested in becoming poets, writers and novelists while most of us generally have a desire of becoming engineers, doctors and scientists of great repute.
It is not easy to choose a career that is suitable or relevant to your major today.
Hundreds of students are leaving schools and universities every year to seek employment in the various professions, though employment opportunities are not increasing proportionately.
As a result, the rate of unemployment is increasing rapidly every year.
Before graduating from school or university, you may have many plans and be confident that choosing a career will not be difficult.
However, after graduation, you will find that there are others with better qualifications waiting to enter the same position.
It means that the job which you are willing to follow, could be taken by others.
In reality, many employees are working in the fields that are not actually relevant to his or her major in schools.
In conclusion, I believe that the dream of becoming a mill-owner or a multi­millionaire can become true or turn out to be nothing.
However, following a career sometimes is just a life of simplicity and goodness devoted to the service of humanity.
Before any decisions to career, you should remember that.
the motto of this life is ‘simple living and high satisfaction.
Sport is a very important thing in our life.
It plays a vital role in keeping our health safe as well as contributing in human personality.
Some of these sports are dangerous like high-speed motor racing.
Many people prefer this dangerous sports and keep practicing regularly.
There are several reasons why many people like motor racing.
The large amount of income and an astonishing fame allowing them to become a global celebrity are some of the main reasons which in turn lead to adrenalin rush among the sport professionals to participate in unsafe sporting activities.
The racing drives are those who daily undergo such high risk conditions, for instance, however, they are willing to do it repeatedly due to the rewards they receive through this.
I think they love to do so because they may feel a sort of lack of confidence, so they try to maintain this point by doing these dangerous sports.
The most striking feature, in my opinion, is the stress in addition to the negative energy that many people have, they need to get rid of their stress by practicing racing.
I tend to see that, these racers should be trained well by professional coaches before they start playing motor racing to minimize any danger that may occur during this practice.
Also, some restrictions should be done for this sport and it should be related to age, as the small children and young ages should be prevented from practicing this kind of sports because they may still young to deal with their dangerous.
Today if there is any institution which has the greatest influence on us after the family, it is the school.
The time that we spend in school are not only time spent in learning and filling our minds with knowledge, but also time spent forming our character, acquiring various attitudes and imbibing basic principles of life.
The basic traits of our personality are formed during our school days.
The name of my school is Nguyen Binh Khiem High School.
It is situated in the suburb of Hai Phong city.
It is considered to be one of the finest schools in the city, highly acclaimed for its excellent for number of talented students.
The school building is an impressive structure.
It consists of four three – floor blocks and has about 36 classrooms.
Classrooms are spacious and airy.
Two staircases at both ends lead to the floors.
The school has a well-equipped library, a well- established science laboratory and two excellent computer room, all of which are situated on the a separate block.
There is an area for learning physical education and sports.
Two cemented basketball courts stand in the right corner, while the school’s football field is in the center of the area.
On the left center, there are two courts for badminton and volleyball.
A small garden full of flower plants surrounds the school building adding to the charm and beauty of the entire complex.
My school has over 1200 students.
Our headmaster is an experienced and efficient person who has been at his job for the last 10 years and more.
Under his able direction, the school has been obtaining many good result and gain the dispute in the city.
The teachers here are well-experienced and knowledgeable in their subjects.
A lot of emphasis are given to character formation, moral education and acquiring good values of life.
Although the school environment is rather strict and time-table based, but there is lot of fun and joy in the school.
Matches, tournaments, musical shows, competitions, events, make my school life lively, interesting and enjoyable.
I am proud to be a student of Nguyen Binh Khiem High school.
People tend to believe that they can only achieve happiness in life by following their "dreams", doing things they really love to do and ignoring any other factors.
In fact, happiness is not something you can measure and evaluate.
Happiness is fluid, flexible and it differs from people to people.
Happiness is unlike a goal which has concrete meaning and limit.
A goal you set can be clearly seen by other people.
However, happiness is something only you can define byyourself.
It is not a goal to achieve, rather it is a feeling you have.
The fluffy and little pleasure you have in your life is what make you happy.
A dream, in the other hand, is more complex and goal-like.
You dream to be a successful business man or a celebrity singer.
You have goals which are long-term and enormous.
However, in most cases, you just dream to be someone else rather than being that person in reality.
This is what we call fantasy dream.
To put it simple, that is an illusion you create to escape from your boring and depressing daily routine.
It has relationwith having the happiness you really want.
The happiness you need is always around you, in your own boring life.
Asking yourself this question to discover your true happiness in life.
what make you feel content, pleasant and thankful.
People blame for their own jobs, hate their devastated state of life they have, but normally forget the small grateful, and serene moments that calm their fluctuating heart.
Remember your favorite songs you repeatedly listen to.
Remember the warm and cozy dinner your mom has made for you after a long, busy day at work.
They can be just small, trivia things in your life but they surely serve you well.
What you are waiting for not in the illusion of becoming someone else, but enjoying your life to its utmost.
My long-term objective is to start up an English Centre by 2020, which will be the first one in Vietnam targeting at Economics students.
The centre, following a four-level structure, will aim at cultivating integrated English skills for learners to facilitate their academic study and research at universities, inspiring them to learn English with endeavour and renovate their own self-studying methods.
Furthermore, learners will also benefit from practical internship opportunities at the centre, as active students will be selected for short-term non-profit training programs and directly involved in organizing quarterly English events under mentors’ guidance.
Through gaining first-hand experience in particular projects, they will also actively boost their pool of soft skills, a key criterion in the recruitment policies of both multinational and domestic enterprises nowadays.
Human beings are designed in such a way that they are in constant need of love, care as well as affection during all times in their lives.
This is the reason why we seek for companionship at each and every point in our life.
We make friends and maintain a closely knit relationship with them because friends not only take away the feeling of void from your life.
they also make us feel secure and accompanied as an individual.
Friendship is considered to be a true blessing for everyone and a person with good friends will have a support system for sharing each and every moment of their life whether it is happy or sad.
I have seen friendships going on for several years and sometimes even for a lifetime with people constantly taking care of each other and maintaining a bond based on trust and care.
Especially for people living away from their homes, friends are nothing short of their family.
Often known as "siblings from different mothers," friends keep us grounded as well as also help us retain the child in us no matter how old we get or how busy we are in leading our professional as well as personal lives.
They are the ones you can run up to in times of any crisis as well as during the happy moments of your life.
Friends are our secret keepers with whom we can share everything without the fear of being judged.
The world might go through a tremendous change but friends are the people we can rely on no matter what.
At times, we may come across situations where we doubt our decisions as well as capabilities.
In situations like these, friends help us by providing us with a reality check.
They never let us down and stand besides us like a rock.
True friends show faith in us and also make us believe in our capabilities keeping aside all negative feelings of jealousy, agony and hatred.
Friends simply do not care if the fault is yours or not, they will stand by you during all times.
They will never stop defending you or putting their trust in you.
They could have seen us in the ugliest of situations and appearances and they simply do not care about these things and still decide to stick by us through every thick and thin.
In conclusion, it can be depressing for each one of us to live alone at times.
In such times, friends become our ultimate support system and they are our cure for loneliness and depression.
Always keeping each others’ back, friends are everything that we need for making our lives beautiful and content.
What makes a creative leader?
Creativity, as an intangible quality, is difficult to describe in fundamental terms.
Likewise, leadership is another virtue that cannot be easily qualified as the impacts of true leadership are far-ranging and difficult to measure.
Couple these two qualities together and what you get is an exceptionally abstract concept that becomes even more challenging to qualify.
Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things.
They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new.
The ability to come up with new ideas is a defining characteristic of creative leaders.
They’re able to step out of the common view and imagine new possibilities that set the course for others to follow.
Creative Leaders anticipate failure.
They eliminate fear of failure to encourage more innovative ideas.
They are not perfectionists who never get it wrong or, worse still.
They are also not the conservatives who never take a risk.
Leadership is a mindset in action.
So don’t wait for the title.
Leadership isn’t something that anyone can give you—you have to earn it and claim it for yourself.
Each of us has a tremendous capacity for becoming a creative leader as we are unique.
Volunteer is one of Vietnam’s long-standing activities contributing effectively to community development, capacity building and poverty reduction.
Volunteer activities are taking place vibrantly with every passing day, not only do they bring positive results from specific volunteer programs but they also conduce to generate and raise awareness for a large number of people in Vietnam.
The key point of volunteer activities is a part of a global effort to ensure that every child has access to a quality education – it’s a direct route out of poverty.
In addition, the activities will be the main distributor of connecting the people, improving the living standard, and helping the poor around countries.
However, the volunteer activities of Vietnam are very diverse in both content and form.
In fact, these volunteer activities remain separate and spontaneous.
information on volunteer activities is not accessible with majority seeking information about specific volunteer programs that interest them due to the lack of coordinating network among volunteer clubs and organizations.
With a tradition of solidarity and compassion, all Vietnamese people profoundly understand that, to rise from a low starting point, each individual has to make every effort to promote internal strength by volunteering to help the needy and contribute to the development of communities and country.
Water shortage is a big concern for many countries around the world.
Drinking water protection is the responsibility of both individuals and governments.
Everyone plays key role in trying to protect the supply of water.
Water is a vital necessity that all people need in order to survive.
Without water, people could only live a few days before having serious health problems or even death.
Many people believe that the use of water should be restricted in some way.
There can be no doubt that there is a limited supply of fresh water, although some parts of the world feel this more acutely than others.
The high rate of populations around the world where fresh water is already severely scarce might lead governments to the firm decision that they should impose restrictions on how water should be used and how much of it each person should be permitted to use.
Whilst I can see that this resolution from government has a certain logic, I think that strict controls are not the final answer.
This severe problem need to be resolved by different ways.
This can be done by building more desalination plants.
However, this is very expensive and some countries could not afford to do this.
Another possibility is to educate people how to use the source of fresh water properly.
Another solution is to protect existing water supplies like underground supplies and take steps to prevent them becoming polluted.
Also, recycled water could be used for irrigating farms.
In conclusion, I believe that governments should ensure that all citizens have sufficient access to fresh water and price it – or allow it to be priced – according to supply and demand.
Besides, all citizens should have full responsibility of protecting the supply of fresh water.
Nowadays, large cities are becoming more and more inhabited because of the tendency of the immigration to the city.
Even though, it brings about many advantages such as more opportunities of jobs and higher living standard, the urban lifestyle make rural dwellers opt to live a different lifestyle than before.
Living in a big city may result in many drawbacks as discussed following.
Urban centers are filled with motorized transport and other sources of pollutants like waste from the large populations of people, or emissions from factories.
The urban centers have very few or even totally missing green spaces with higher amount of pollutants that are so harmful for citizens.
For a long time, lung cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma are just a few diseases common among urban dwellers.
Another disadvantage of living in a city is traffic congestion.
Every day, many people have to struggle with the transportation jams, who usually face with being late in their office.
They are always stuck for many hours on the way to work.
In addition, more transports on the street are the main distributor of air pollution which can lead to many bad effects on man’s health.
It is undeniable that the cost of living in big cities is much higher than in countryside.
The impact of this can result in the expensive cost of the public services such as health service, postal service, education.
It will be difficult for the poor and workers to live in big cities with a low minimum wage.
They seem to struggle with the rapid changes in the price of basic necessities and public services like hospitals, schools.
Ao Dai the a traditional dress of Vietnam.
It is one of the symbols of Vietnam.
When one hears about Vietnam, the word "Ao Dai" will most probably be mentioned.
Early versions of the "Ao Dai" date back to 1744 when Lord Vu Vuong of the Nguyen Dynasty decided both men and women should wear an outfit of pants and a gown that buttoned down the front.
What wasn’t, until 1930 that "Ao Dai"appear similar to what it looks today.
Now, Men wear it less, generally only on ceremonial occasions such as weddings or funerals.
During the 1950s two tailors in Saigon started producing "Ao Dai" with raglan sleeves.
This creates a diagonal seam running from the collar to the underarm.
This style is still preferred today"Ao Dai" is made individually to fit each customer’s shape to create the most flattering look.
Its body-hugging top flows over wide trousers that brush the floor.
The pants should reach the soles of the feet and flow along the floor.
Comfortability is always taken into account for fashions and beauty.
Tailors must be skills so as to ensure the wearer has freedom of movement.
Despite it being a long robe, "Ao Dai" is cool to wear.
Synthetic or silk fabrics are best to use because they do not crush and dry quickly.
For this reason "Ao Dai" is a practical uniform for daily wear.
The color can show the wearer’s age and status.
Young girls wear pure white, fully-lined outfits symbolizing their purity.
Older but unmarried girls move into soft pastel shades.
Only married women wear "Ao Dai" in strong, rich colors, usually over white or black pants.
"Ao Dai"is rarely seen in places where manual work is practiced.
In the nineties the Ao dai become popular again.
It has become standard and common attire for female students as well and staff at offices and hotels.
Ao dai nowadays is very popular with different designs and colors.
"Ao Dai"has become the most preferred dress for formal occasions and traditionally ceremonies.
Today, "Ao Dai" has been modified.
Its length is cut shorter usually just below the knee.
Variations in the neck, between boat and mandarin style, are common.
Access to new fabrics have made for some interesting design most visitors to Vietnam admire local tailors’ skills when making ao dai.
It is hard to think of a more elegant, demure and charming outfit, that suits Vietnamese women of different ages, than Ao Dai.
Consumers in many countries are encouraged to consume more products.
From an economic perspective, there is a constructive culprit of development for production, whilst there is a pervasive anxiousness about the adverse impact of shopaholic tendency on the society.
If a greater demand for products is stimulated, the production will be developed to meet this market needs.
The decision of manufacturers is affected by the capacity of consumption for products which is the key contributor to their profits.
Consumers are favorable with their products, thereby an increase in their profits induces to the extending production scales.
For example, Vietnamese noodle corporations, in recent years, have diversified and developed their products thanks to the high demand for instant noodle.
On the other hand, through an increasingly more materialistic mentality along with mass marketing, citizens are getting addicted to shopping.
Instead of exerting their spending efficiently, they are willing to afford to new products which following by trend.
The majority of them have struggled with overspending that triggers to their burden of debt.
Moreover, shopaholic tendency can predispose to break off their responsibility.
For example, their responsibility of mothers for ensuring a balanced and nutritious diet for their kids by home cooked meals will be replaced with habit of buying fast food owing to the available to the convenient food in stores or restaurants.
In conclusion, benefits of encouraging consumption for efficient production from economic perspectives are undeniable.
However, uncontrolled spending and debt as well as bad habits are negative of this trend.
There are many valuable things in life, but friendship may be one of the most important.
A friend may be defined as.
" a person whom you know, like and trust".
But to all, friendship has no clearly defined terminology.
The definition of a friend, and friendship, is based upon our own notions.
True friendship is a feeling of love, sharing and caring.
It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are, without any exaggeration, flattery and pretensions.
It gives a feeling that you are "unique" and that you are "someone" and not a faceless being in the crowd.
A true friend stands by you through thick and thin.
Lasting friendship is indeed, a blessing.
Good friends are great pillars of life.
They help us to stand tall and erect in life.
Friendship can make or break us.
It can lead to good careers and proper living.
It does not matter how often you meet your friends, but how much you care and feel for another in good times as well as in bad times.
True friendship is a great asset in life.
Friends are needed in every stage of life.
Friendship has no age limit.
Every group of people-children, youth, elders, very elderly people, have their friends.
Famous saying states that.
To live life without the experience of friendship, is life without living.
My mother is the most important person in my life.
She is an inspiration to everything I do.
I would not call her a friend, but she is an extraordinary person.
She has been in my life since I was born and she will always be in my life no matter what happens.
She is the one who has suffered to bring me into this world.
I have learnt to love her since the day I was born.
My mother was the first person to teach me to draw and walk, and she was with me when I took my first step ever!
She has taught me to believe in people and not to have grudges against one another.
She always encouraged me to go along when I was ready to give up.
She made sure that I was safe and happy throughout my childhood.
It is the unconditional love that my mother gives to me.
It is hard to describe the feeling that a mother has towards her children.
Mothers give an awful lot of support to their children, whether it involves very visible support or simple back encouragement.
Not only do mothers support their children, but they also often hold the whole family structure together.
When all is well, a mother puts her children before anything else, including their own comfort and happiness.
Describing a mother's love is virtually impossible.
It is a feeling that can only truly be understood by those that experienced it.
Famous saying states that "God could not be everywhere and so he invented mothers!
Garment Technologists can be employed by manufacturers or large, high-street retailers.
Working in the manufacturing and production industry, a technologist has a role in selecting and testing the ideal fabric or material for products.
A clothing or textile technologist works with a variety of fabrics, both man-made and natural fibers, as well as leather, fur, metals and plastics.
As a technologist, you’ll find fabrics or textiles that are fit for purpose and carry out quality control tests.
You’ll work on the development of products, improving production efficiency and quality, while incorporating with those involved in the production process.
Some technologists specialize in research and product development and may implement research to find new ways of using yarns, develop chemicals that may be added into fabrics to make them more waterproof, flame-resistant or shrink-resistant, and experiment with textiles to improve their look, feel, texture and durability.
You will need to have a high level of technical knowledge and strong practical skills, the ability to work as part of a team and to liaise with colleagues in other tasks.
Besides, you have to master organizational skills, to ensure time schedules are adhered to and deadlines are met.
It will be useful if you have got an interest in, and understanding of computer technology.
An idol is a person who has a big influence on your life in many ways.
I consider my Dad as my idol.
He is the most respectable and important person in my life.
He has influenced not only my life but the life of my whole family.
My Dad is working as a Regional Manager in State Bank of India.
He has worked very hard in his entire life to make sure that I and all my family members have everything that we need and do not lack anything.

Not only I but also my friends discuss their personal issues with my Dad.
He is patient, caring, loving and understanding.
He listens to my ideas about successful life diligently and shows me how to reach that point.
Even in bad situations he keeps himself collected and cool and never loses his temper.
My family plays an important role in my father’s life.
Owing to his job he is always occupied with work pressure.
But then he manages to take out time for us from his busy schedule.
He is the strongest person I have ever known.
He has always guided us to live a spiritual and free life.
He will always be my hero.
To me, he is the best father in the world and my love and respect for him cannot be framed in words.
Environmental pollution has made negative effects on the life of every living things on Earth.
Nearly all of our achievements in the fields of industrial progress, science and technology have been realized at the cost of our health so far.
Even our flora and fauna have been found to be at risk of extinction.
All this really makes us wondering whether all our gains and industrial civilization really enable us to climb the peaks of prosperity or simply bring us down the blind alleys of adversity.
Many programs against environmental pollution are strenuously implemented against the indiscriminate violations committed daily in the name of development.
The environmental pollution is not only caused by the emission from nuclear tests or industries.
The smoke from the automobiles and other vehicles, the increasing use of synthetic detergents, nitrogen insecticides and fertilizers contaminate both air and water.
The water we use to drink the vegetables are all contaminated.
As a result, our world is suffering from a number of incurable diseases.
Nothing in this world is immune, no life is safe and the prospect of this world is bleak.
The factories are mostly built in residential areas and the smoke-emitting vehicles ply through the congestion areas.
Besides causing immense disturbances, it also leads to increasing number of case of pulmonary thrombosis and tuberculosis and various sorts of brain and heart complications.
Air-pollution may cause severe lung diseases, brain-disorder diseases, asthma.
Soil-pollution may negatively affect farm output ratio.
It can also contaminate the groundwater.
Noise-pollution have negative effects on hearing ability.
It can also cause deafness, tiredness, and mental losses.
The heat generated by industries and vehicles causes thermal pollution by raising the environmental temperature of the nearby areas.
The birth of mills and factories is the result of the growth of industry in this machine-predominated period.
As long as they will be there, they must emit smoke, pollute the air and hasten our end by slow-poisoning.
For teenagers, having a job is a way of earning money, just a way of having extra cash for movies or clothes.
It makes us feel independent.
Personally, it made me feel like an adult.
It taught me how to take responsibility and handle my finances.
I had to learn how to take public transportation, interact with my coworkers, work with different types of people, and also learn about punctuality.
In a way, it was almost like I had learned real life skills within 3 months.
I will never forget my first job experience.
It will always be a big part of my maturing and becoming a young adult.
Our supervisors helped us get familiar with Google Apps.
We played with it, did tutorials, did assignments until we knew what we were doing like the backs of our hands.
Finally, after a fortnight we were ready to start on a first project.
We were all assigned some clients and began building websites for them.
It was an interesting experience and I loved every step of it.
Not only did we build websites for clients, we did onsite training for different companies and helped them get acquaintance with Google Apps.
It required us to speak in front of public and be willing to answer questions.
It was nerve-wracking but my supervisor was there every step of the way, guiding and correcting my mistakes.
Week by week, time passed.
Before I knew it, it was the last day of my internship.
Both of my supervisors gave us some useful advice on furthering our future careers.
My internship has taught me many beneficial things.
They are to always have an open mind and be willing to work in any type of environment, to be willing to adapt to a new work place and be respectful and kind to not only my future supervisors but my coworkers as well.
What I have learned in the span of three months will always be a big part of me growing up.
I’m looking forward to taking what I’ve learned and applying it.
Whoever you are, you have the right to dream of your future job.
I also have one.
That is my desire to become a teacher.
Just thinking of my job, I feel so happy.
My friends often ask me that.
Why do you choose teaching?.
I smile.
I choose this job, because I love children so much.
I want to take care of them, teach them how to read, how to write, how to listen and show them the beautiful things of this life.
Teaching is similar to growing a tree up, you must have patience,carefulness, and passion.
And one of the important reasons that makes me choose this job is my parents.
They hope that I can complete your dream.
In Viet Nam, the salary of a teacher is quite low, but I still want to become a teacher, simply becauseI love this job and I believe in my love, as well as my passion for this job.
In the future, I will become a good teacher.
And now, I’m trying my best to complete the program in university to make my dream come true.
Smoking cigarettes is an expensive habit.
You can see, the average price per pack of cigarettes isabout 1 dollar, people who smoke 2 packs of cigarettes per daywill spend $2 one day on their habit.
At the end of a year those smokers will incur a debt.
Since smoking has an offensive odor that permeates into clothing,stuffed carpets and furniture, smokers often find that they must have those items cleaned more frequently than nonsmokers do.
Furthermore, a smoker would pay a lot of money for many diseasescaused by smoking.
Although it’s difficult to sum the cost of those additional expenses, I can say that the expenses do contribute to making smoking become a very expensive habit.
Watching television is my favourite activity I like doing in my free time.
I enjoy watching somesport programs on Saturday afternoons and movies and cartoons on Sunday mornings.
Ialways watch televisionduring the week after I have done all my homework.
At night, I like to watchcomedies and movies.
If I have a lot of homework, I will arrange my schedule so that I will have time to watch at least 1 of my favorite shows.
Watching television isn’t the only activity that I do in my free time.
One of my favorite activitiesis going shopping with my friends and making paper flowers.
However, I spend more time for watching television than many other activities.
Watching televisionmake me relax and provide me with a huge amount of knowledge about the world.
If you want to know.
what is the eternityin life ?
Only the answer is the sacrifice of mother.
Today, I rememberher in the last days of the year, remember the sacrifice that she has given me.
My mother always solves matters in life with sentiment , she is a sensitive woman.
Everything were taken care by her, even animal.
Sometimes, I feel jealousbecause I'm her daughter, I think I should be given more carethan all.
I'm becoming the more egoistic when I stay besidethat great woman.
She always tells me .
when you grow up, , don'tcompare the sentiment with anything in small life, especially motherhood ( it's everlasting ) and you will know how to express your feeling to someone in different ways, not possession bythe jealousy"All the things she do are just tohelp me to be a better human.
But I think if I can be a woman like her, It would be as great as I have all the world.
Today, Everyone goes back home, the city is not as noisy as the some days ago .
May be, they come back to their friendly family and prepare for Tet holiday.
My mother will be asking my sister .
why your younger sister is not staying at home, now ? 
I see all the otherstudents come back to their home, my daughter is still busy with part time job, isn't she ?
she will ask my sister until I come home.
I can say with certainty and I'm so happy aboutit.
since the very beginning of my schooling day as far as I remember, Ihave had an attraction for Mathematics.
Mathematics always gives me extra energy and satisfaction in my study.
I never feelbored with this subject.
As my father is an engineer, he always helps me to learn the subject well.
Also, he teaches me with a great technique of visual representation.
He createsa collection of intuitive Youtube videos for my favorite subject.
I like learning my favourite subject with myfull energy and want to become a mathematician or mathematics professor.
I like my favorite subject ( Mathematics) because of many reasons.
firstly, This subject doesn't need memorizingskill like what a parrot often does.
Only logical thinking is sufficient for this subject.
secondly, Mathematics always remains evergreen in demand in the field of education.
Lastly, Without it many life goals cannot be achieved.
It is the only subject in which anyone can score full marks andin almost case marks can be improved.
So these are the reasons why I have selected this subject to be my most favoriteone.
I practicemathematics by writing various formulas regularly.
This helps to give outimmediate ideasto solve any problems quickly.
I enjoy practicing critical sums of maths.
I always score above 95% in this subject.
It give me a lot of confidence and enjoyment.
Our environment is getting worse day by day, and we are suffering forour mistakes.
It's getting harder and harder for our families to stay healthy with all the bad thingsaround us every day.
We are affected by our environment, andmore and more people are found to be caught with diseases.
This could affect our families and our future one day.
We might not be able to see all of the bad things in our environment, but for sure, they are existing.
Although certain groups are most vulnerable, toxic substances in the environment affect every person andall of us have to take responsibility for them.
This saying supports my opinion about the cause because it is saying there aredangerous substances in our environment that we are responsible for.
We are getting sick and even dying because of the bad thingshuman are putting into the environment.
These health problems killed around more than 15.000victims in the year that followed.
Approximately 100.000 people still suffer from chronic diseases which are consequencesof gas exposure, today.
This is also stating that the things in our air are killing us.
All of this dangerous toxicsare the cause of getting diseases which are killing the people we love.
The winter of Hanoi starts from December and may last until the February, with the average temperature of 15-17°C.
Sometimes it drops to below 10°C and the high humidity will make the weather a little bit colder.
Remember to bring warm clothes if you don't want to get a cold when visiting a tropical country.
Winter often brings a sad feeling, because the sky is often dark and gloomy.
However, Hanoi seems to have its busiest days of the year and streets are more crowded than usual during working hours as people are in rush to complete all the remaining works and prepare for Tet holiday.
The cold weather enables people living in Hanoi or visitors to enjoy the tasty hot food like hotspot or grilled dishes.
Hanoi in early winter morning, the mist makes special beauty for the city.
Somewhere people carrying bunches of flowers cycle slowly in the quiet air.
Men prefer a hot cup of tea, sitting on the sidewalk evaporates, watching the flow of people back and forth.
Hanoi young women walk downstreet in beautiful clothes.
The children wear tightly when they are out, though only playing at doorstep.
The old, with glasses of cold beer, talk about life.
We can also catch the image of street venders struggling when it rains.
The winter is one of many beauties of Hanoi.
It's worth coming and enjoying the atmosphere in Hanoi.
In the past, I always thought that game online was a bad thing, because there were many people studying lazily and making their parents worry because of playing games too much.
But when I grow up, I realize that I mistake passion for addiction.
As the same, game online always has advantages and disadvantages.
The hotter a method of entertainment becomes, the more young people try it.
They don't need to know how the game is.
They will spend time on it, forget to work on the exercise, neglect their study at school.
At first, they want to keep up with the trend but then, it's hard for them to leave out that habit, which leads to serious consequences.
They attach importance on win, spend a lot of money on game to satisfy themselves.
They forget that playing game is just a means of entertainment after stressful classes so they easily get addicted.
However, there are some advantage of game online.
Firstly, we can react in the fastest way in all circumstances, we can become a game creator and have good team-work skills.
Secondly, we can explore the way of any game that is controlled, find the rules in each game and developed their idea in the future.
You can also have best friend and live more responsibly.
The most important thing is that people who play game have happy time, relax to concentrate on learning or working.
Game online is not bad, but their way play make it become bad.
Let try on playing a game one time and you won't feel disappointed.
When I was thirteen years old, Women's volleyball team of Viet Nam took part in the competition with other countries in the Southeast Asia region.
They played really wonderfully and I admired Mrs. Pham Thi Kim Hue who was a talent and beautiful female volleyball player.
Then, I decided to sign in the volleyball club in my school, I practiced some of basic volleyball skills in this club.
Of course, my parent didn't know because I didn't tell them.
At that time, I dreamed that I would become a as good volleyball player as Mrs. Pham Thi Kim Hue.
Every afternoon when classes ended, I played with my team (some of members in club) in two hours, we relaxed about 15 minutes, told some of the jokes, smiled together very happily.
After other members left, I stayed with hope.
The team leader could teach me more.
About a week later, my body hurt and appeared so much scratches, especially my arms.
Therefore, I hadn't been accustomed to strong activities for a long time before.
I consoled myself and continued practicing.
One day, while I were playing volleyball, I fell down in the slippery floor.
As a result, my right arm was broken, my parent was worried, their tear made me feel remorseful.
Since then, I sometime play volleyball but I realize.
Only love is never enough, your dream will be not perfect without the passion.
The past, I don't like the cooking.
One day, I just raised my head to surprise two eyes starting at me when I was holding a piece of almond cake.
He said.
can you make it?
I like it so much.
The fact, it was my friend but Ipromised that.
I will make a almond cake for him.
So, he was look handsome .
Today, I get up early and go to supermarket to buy some of raw material.
Needinga lot of ingredients.
1 cup sliced almonds, butter, purpose flour, 4 egg yolks, 2 large egg whites, whole milk, vanilla extract, fresh lemon juice, black berries, raspberries, salt, sugar.
After make a almond cake, I feel this very interesting.
It's too difficult to complete.
May be, I should make it in the future, the more one time.
I hope he like a cake I make painfully.
I will give for him, tomorrow.
I have never imagined to make a cake that have many processing stages.
But I promised, I will try my best.
Everybody in my family believe that.
I don't love my dad as the same the different children.
Because when I was 2 months old,I have always cried loudly whenever he come on, until I was 10 years old,I rarely talked to him.
I didn't know why was I do?
May be, I loved my father so much!
My dad is regularly busy, he has to go away my home, such as a working trip.
So, I live with my mom, my sister and my grandparents, I looking forward to the date he come back.
Despite the fact that I often cry, hide behind the door when I see him.
I keep in eye of the dad's action I feel happy so he is beside me.
If he take care of my sister the better than me, I will cry again.
My father is a quiet, taciturn and good man, he make people fell safe and comfortable.
He always buys gift for me, he hope to close to me and see his daughter scurrying, the walked up to him, gave him a kiss on the check and say.
I love you, dad.
Many time, I imagined this and promised myself that.
I will live by my true feelings, won't fear the break up again.
A long time past, my dad was retired but I went to school away from home so we rarely see each other.
When I have a free time, I phone to him and talk to funny stories that I see, talk to boyfriend that I like.
Suddenly, I realize one thing, without my father, is not the more perfect man appear in my life.
Having happiness, having sadness, we need accustomed to it.
I were come back my childhood, I will hide in the cabinet to look over the dad's action.
One thing is the most important in the present.
he have known my feelings.
Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February.
it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam.
Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar.
however, Vietnamese people often spend about nearly a month to celebrate this special event.
Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year.
however, its preparation starts long before that.
One week before the holiday, in the 23rd day of the last Lunar month, is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong).
It is believed that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth.
On the New Year's Eve, they return to earth to continue their duties as taking care of families.
On the New Year's Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they are believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).
After that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends and colleagues, wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health and success.
Many people ponder what they should do for a vacation and I realized a lot of people don't seem to share our views about traveling.
I believe it's very important to see the world and different cultures.
It lets us open our minds to new things and we get to experience life in exiting different ways.
Traveling gives us the opportunity to disconnect from our regular life.
You get to forget your problems for a few weeks, it can also help you figure things out that you would not have understood without the distance traveling can give you.
We all have crazy schedules, work and a family to take care of, going away alone or with some friends can give you distance and perhaps even make you realize how important these people are for you .
Like the saying says.
we never know what we have until we lose it.
Another great benefit is the relaxation you get to do.
It's nice to live life to its fullest and enjoy a stress free time with yourself.
Going on vacation lets us recharge our "batteries" by disconnecting us from our regular life.
When we come back we feel invigorated and we are happy to be back in our day to day routine.
It's a very good stress remover that has a lot more to give than most people are willing to accept.
Traveling increases our knowledge and widens our perspective.
To view new customs, different ways of living is fantastic for the mind.
It gives us a new perspective about life and especially our life, it can help us change some of our habits or even create new ones.
When I travel I usually make it a point to try new food, some cultures don't have fries in their diet and they are all skinny, others use spices to give taste and not oils or fats.
Discovering different values and ways to get by in life is really interesting.
You also need to visit exotic new places and discover what this wonderful world has to offer.
New experiences increase our resourcefulness by living situations you would never encounter at home, this is great experience for you when you come back to your routine.
I have noticed that people who traveled a lot in life were ready to embrace change and have a natural ability of overcoming problems that others would frown upon.
When traveling with friends or family it creates memories for a lifetime.
These memories will create a bond that nothing can erase no matter what happens with the friendship.
It can also give a new perspective on the relationship and cement the bond forever.
It also gives nice stories to tell people afterwards, you can create photo albums about your trips and when you feel nostalgic you can take an hour of your life and experience the trips again by looking at your pictures.
It's never been this cheap to travel.
With soaring oil prices the cheap travel era might be coming to an end.
However there are still many budget airlines fighting for your dollar right now.
With the internet and all the new technology, you can plan your trip exactly the way you want it.
You can choose your budget, the duration of the trip and what you want to do.
I suggest to read travel blogs and see what others are experiencing, you can save yourself a few hurdles by reading about their trip.
If you have some time off I suggest to take that trip and experience what life has to offer.
Don't wait or tell yourself there will be a better time to go.
Take the risk, the opportunity and buy your plane ticket right now and leave.
When you come back you won't be sorry that you left, on the contrary you will be thinking of your next trip the second you come back from the airport.
Feel free to let me know how traveling helped you out, what new experiences you lived and how they helped you in your life.
Michael Jackson is one of my favorite singers.
He is very famous, so most of all people in the world know him, at least his name.
I began to listen to his songs because I was recommended them by my friend, and I was really attracted by them.
I have two reasons why I like him.
To me, one of my best friends is Thành .
Thành is only over eighteen but he is well developed.
so he is thought to be twenty or more.
He has black hair, a broad forehead, a straight nose and bright eyes.
He is very good-looking.
He has a kind heart and is easy to get on with everybody.
We have been friends for a very long time.
The deeper our mutual understanding becomes the more we feel closely attached to each other.
Thành and I are keen on learning.
We are the best pupils in our class.
Thành is always at the top.
He is good at every subject, but he never shows pride in his abilities and always tries to learn harder.
Thành's family is not rich enough.
His parents are retired workers.
Realizing the hardships of his parents, although he is absorbed in his study, he often spends most of his spare time doing useful things to help his parents in their old age.
He gets up early in the morning to have enough time to deliver newspapers to subscribers before going to school.
After school in the afternoon, he repairs bicycles and motorbikes.
Therefore the money he gets from his manual job is sufficient for his school fees and for his parents' presents.
I like Thành very much because of his honesty and straight forwardness.
He is always ready to help his weak friends in their study.
as a result, lots of friends, thanks to his whole-hearten help, have become good ones.
My name is Tram and I am from Binh Dinh province or Vietnam.
I am currently studying Finance and Economics at Van Lang University.
I was raised in Binh Dinh and when I was 18 I moved to Ho Chi Minh city to take my university study.
Last year I went to Da Nang city to join the school's exchange program.
During my exchange I went backpacking with other backpackers from all over the city to other province or city across Vietnam.
It was a fun experience.
I think I have been fortunate enough to be able to live in different parts of our country and thus be able to broaden my horizon.
I have a strong interest in banking and financial services industry.
The reason is I'd like to leverage my detail-oriented mind and apply the skills and knowledge that I have attained throughout my degree courses.
I see myself as a people-oriented and over-achiever person.
I demonstrated this through working in various group projects with different types of people in which I had been able to perform well.
My strengths are my attitude that I like to take challenges that I CAN do it, self motivated person, self disciplined I am a good team player as well as has a good ability to lead the team.
I can adopt to any kind of environment.
I am a good listener and quick learner.
My weakness is I can not tolerate any leniency in work My short term goal is I want a such a platform where I can grow my career along with the organisation growth like yours and.
My Long term goal is I want to be one of the reason for the success of the organisation and I want to see your organisation as a bench mark to other organisations.
I would like to be part of your company to further develop myself in banking field and to use my capabilities to serve both your company and your clients.
Thats all about me sir.
Thank you for giving me such a wonderful opportunity.
Friendship is the most valuable relationship in the life of a person instead of having many important things in life.
No one of us has a complete and satisfied life if we lack faithful friendship.
Everyone needs a good and loyal friend to share bad or good life events, enjoy happy moments and share unbearable events of the life.
A good and balanced human interaction is very necessary for the survival of everyone.
Good friends share each other's emotions or sentiments which bring feeling of well being and mental satisfaction.
A friend is a person whom one can know deeply, like and trust forever.
Instead of being some similarity in the nature of two persons involved in the friendship, they have some different traits but they need each other without changing their uniqueness.
Generally, friends motivate each other without criticizing but sometimes good friends criticize to bring some positive changes in each other.
Environment is an essential part of our life.
A clean environment is necessary for a peaceful and healthy life.
An environment is the natural surroundings which helps human beings, animals and other living things to grow and develop naturally.
But nowadays, our environment is disturbing in many different ways.
Any type of disturbance in the nature's balance affects the environment totally.
It does not only ruin human lives but also affects on all living beings.
We can save our environment with the little step taken by everyone on the earth.
We should reduce the amount of waste, throwing wastes properly to its place only.
and many other simple ways.
It is very important to save environment for human existence.
When we protect the environment, we are protecting ourselves and our future as well.
Friendship is one of the most precious presents of life.
Friendship makes life, sweet and pleasant experience.
Friendship is indeed, an asset in life.
Friendship is good and necessary.
Man cannot live all alone because he is a social being.
He needs someone to share his joys and sorrows.
There goes a saying"Friendship increases happiness and diminishes misery by doubling our joy and dividing our grief".
Friendship can make or break us.
It all depends on how we choose our friends.
We spent much of our time with them.
Their mental outlook, behaviour, attitudes affect us too.
Today, many youngsters have become social nuisance mainly due to bad friends.
Therefore, we have to choose our friends very carefully.
We have to remember the maxim "All that glitters is not gold".
We have to distinguish between fair-weather friends and true friends.
True friends remain with us through thick and thin while fair-weather friends are found only during sunny days.
True friendship is a feeling of love, sharing and caring.
It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are, without any flattery.
It gives a feeling that you are 'wanted' and that you are 'someone' and not a faceless being in the crowd.
True friendship knows no boundaries of caste, creed, race and sex.
Good friends are great pillars of life.
A person who has true friends in life is lucky enough.
It does not matter how often you meet your friends, but how much you care and feel for another in good times as well as in bad times.
Everybody has their own type of hobby.
Mine tends to be a little delicate, and it requires me to put in such tender care and love.
That is, gardening.
My boyfriend and I live together in a small house, even though the size of the house itself is not ideal compare to other houses nowadays, but it's still fully equipped.
And, the only one special thing that makes our house stand out, is our backyard garden.
My boyfriend shares the same interest for gardening as me.
We always spend times together taking care of the garden every day.
Covering the entire yard is a grass carpet of deep green.
The garden of us gathers a diversity of colors from many kinds of flower such as Roses, Lilies, Sunflowers.
Likewise, our garden is also covered by one such soothing aroma from the bushes of Orange Jasmine (hoa nguyệt quế).
Watering, fertilizing, as well as pruning (tỉa lá), are some small works that we do to take care of our lovely garden.
They might sound simple, but in order to complete such those small acts, you have to give in your real effort and love.
If you could do so, I truly believe you yourself would be able to own a spectacular garden that blooms out not only lively colors, but also a unique fragrance, just like our garden.
An ideal family with 2 children.
Previously, Our Ancestor often thought that the more children we had, the more happines we found.
However, in reality, a large family will lead to a lot of problems for the family in particular and for the development of society in general.
Many social studies have shown an ideal family is a family with two children.
This is a perfect model for couples with a modern lifestyle because it can overcome various problems that can occur in a family.
Specifically here is how people take care of their children.
In 1 minute, your children may hurt themselves by playing with sharp objects such as knife.
Many kids have met tragic accident when they participate in playful activities by water without adult supervision.
So parents will take care for children easier and more attentive when they only have two children.
Nurturing is another challenge for parents.
However, according to a government report by a government agency, the children raised in families with two children often have better behavior than the kids who have too many brothers and sisters.
The children born and raised in a family with few children will get more attention and lessons from from their parents.
Instead of wresting love from their parents, these children are also gainmore opportunities to be heard and to share.
Another problem will be solved when a family decides to have few children is finance.
We can not deny the necessity of money in guarantee a fulfilled life and a brighter future for our children.
Money will be used to pay for education and health care fee when children are sick.
On the contrary, in a overcrowded home, parents will be faced more financial burden, especially when the kids are born closely with their siblings.
The problem can becomes worse if the family fell into difficult circumstances and do not have enough ability to send their children to school, the children will easily involve into crime matters and became sorrow not only for their parents but also for the society.
My hobby is reading knowledgeable and interesting books in my square time.
Reading is such a good habit which healthy for your brain and keeps your brain functioning actively.
Reading is a wonderful way to keeps you relax and happy.
For me, there is nothing makes me happier than to have a stack of books on my nightstand to attack on a night when there is no alarm clock waiting the next morning.
It's the great source of enjoyment, inspiration , instruction, and knowledge.
Reading book can make us disciplined, punctual, loyal and most importantly a very successful person in this life.
While reading books, noone can feel disturb or alone.
I think this hobby is more precious than other precious stones in the world.
It can provide us noble thoughts, ideas to work in many fields and high level of knowledge.
Interesting and knowledgeable book is like best friend of the someone who likes to read.
Book is one part of my beautiful life and reading book has definitelybeen my favourite hobby.
I will be able to never forget the interesting moment when my father gave me the first book which is full of colourful pictures.
I was very delighted though I difficultly understood what were there in that book.
I read wherever, whenever, and whatever kinds of books, from short story, comic, to novel and many more.
My father always encourages me to read book and He buys me many useful and interesting books.
Books are like my friends who can teach me many things over the world.
They let me know of a lot of beautiful places and the history of our country and many others.
My tears come from those books and so do my happy laughters.
Most free time of mine is spent on discovering books, books are very useful and so great.
Reading books is the most interesting indoor activities that you should try.
It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system.
Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase.
There are two key factors behind this trend.
For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use.
The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet.
As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production.
In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a "stock" economy to a "flow" economy.
This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users.
However, a new imperative-sustainable development – offers an opportunity for adapting the EU，s common transport policy.
This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy.
The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years‟ time, that is by 2040.
The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing.
This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of transport.
In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport.
However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton.
The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics, technology).
However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regional cohesion.
It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion‟s share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes.
It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance.
The tallest building in Europe is nearly complete.
Rising above a new waterfront complex in St.Petersburg, Russia, the Lakhta Center's tower stands at 462 meters (1,516 feet) tall, making it the city's first supertall building (one measuring 300 meters or above).
The structure is now the northernmost skyscraper in the world, according to its developers.
The 87-story tower twists a full 90 degrees from its foundation to its top, like a winding needle.
This makes it one of the world's tallest examples of a twisted skyscraper design.
Its soaring height is offset by a lower mixed-use building with a 260-meter-long (853-foot-long) facade.Residential and commercial space will be installed up to a height of 360 meters (1,181 feet), above which an observation deck and restaurant will offer breathtaking views over the Gulf of Finland.
The Lakhta Center takes the title of Europe's tallest building from Moscow's Federation Tower, completed in 2017, which stands at 374 meters (1,227 feet).
Moscow is also home to five of the next six entries in the list, interrupted only by London's Shard, which was briefly the continent's tallest in 2012, at 310 meters (1,016 feet) tall.
The firm is set to move in by the end of 2019.
According to Philip Nikandrov, one of the architects involved with the project, the exterior of the building will be completed by the end of this summer, although the interior fitting will continue into 2019.
Drone images show the main tower's impressive silhouette, which was designed to symbolize a flame -- a distinctive feature of Gazprom's logo.
Every year on May 5th of the lunar calendar, some countries China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam have Mid-year Festival.
In China, on this day, they celebrate a festival called Dragon Bloat Festival.
In Vietnam, the festival celebrated on May 5th is called Tet Doan Ngo, Worm-killing Festivalof Vietnamese.
Some researchers think that the celebration has its origin in China.
There is a legend Qu Yuan – Chinese poet who lived during the Warring States period of ancient China.
In Vietnam, we call him Khuat Nguyen.
He was a faithful person but living in the empire in decline.
He hindered the king from making some bad decisions.
Other officials devised false stories about him.
The king did not follow his advice and hated him.
He was so sad and drowned himself in the Mich La, China on May 5th of the lunar calendar.
Chinese people regretted the person having a clear heart.
Every year, on this day, people made cakes with five-color strings and dropped them to the river to offer Khuat Nguyen.
They tied five-color strings on the cakes in order to make fishes afraid and do not dare to eat the cakes.
They also poured rice into bamboo tubes and dropped them into the river.
The custom gradually spread through some nearby countries.
Vietnamese people call this day Worm-killing Festival because most farmers start killing worms on their rice fields and orchards.
Vietnamese ancestors had told us a story about Doi Truan who taught farmers how to kill a lot of worms in fruits and rice.
He offered Banh gio (a kind of Pyramid sticky rice cake), fruits to Gods in front of a house.
He told that if all farmers did the same things on the same day every year, all worms will be weaker and killed easily.
The man had disappeared after helping killing worms.
Nowadays, grandparents tell their children about the stories, teach them to be grateful to ancestors and the country's tradition.
FLC chairman to increase stakes.
Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of FLC, has registered to increase his ownership in the property company by 2.1 percentage points.
He said in a recent statement he would buy 15 million shares between June 26 and July 25 to increase his stake to 23.3 percent.
With FLC trading at VND4,200 (18 cents) at the time of publishing, the acquisition will cost him around VND63 billion ($2.7 million).
Quyet had said last year he would spend VND1.5-2 trillion ($65-86 million) in 2020 to acquire more FLC shares. The share price has fallen by 11 percent this year.
He has been selling his stake in FLC Faros, a construction arm of FLC, from 51.3 percent to 4.17 percent for over VND900 billion ($39 million), and resigned as chairman of the company.
An FLC Faros spokesperson said the divestment could mean Quyet wants to focus more on the parent company and the carrier it owns, Bamboo Airways.
FLC, a developer of resorts and golf courses, expects a loss of VND1.96 trillion ($84 million) this year due to the impacts of the coronavirus.
Two Vietnamese schools feature in global U50 ranking.

Insurance company to cover VND 3.5-billion treatment cost of British pilot.
An insurance company will bear the cost of VND 3.5 billion to treat the 91st patient, a British pilot, who was the country's most critical case of Covid-19, at the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
The company has sent a payment confirmation to the hospital, paying the entire cost of treatment of the 43-year-old man from March 18 to May 22, Nguoi Lao Dong Online reported.
A representative of the hospital said the treatment cost escalated when the patient needed the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to allow his lungs and heart to improve and function properly.
The patient also suffered blood clotting disorders and the anticoagulants sold in the local market failed to treat him, the representative said, adding that, as such, the Ministry of Health allowed other anticoagulants from foreign markets to be imported.

Father, son jailed for raping disabled woman.
A Binh Thuan Province court has sentenced a father and son to three and nine years each for raping, impregnating an intellectually disabled woman.
Nguyen Thanh Tam, 43, was jailed for three years while his 20-year-old son Nguyen Huu Thanh got nine years after the latter was identified as the father of the baby, the court ruled Monday.
Both were forced to pay VND70 million ($3,016) in compensation for mental trauma and supporting the mother in raising the child.
According to the indictment, Thanh and the victim were cousins.
In late 2018, he visited her home in Ham Thuan Nam District in the south-central Binh Thuan Province, noting she lived alone.
Thanh later forced her into a room where he raped her on two different occasions in the following days.
Thanh's father also visited the victim's home where he continued to rape her.
Tam threatened to kill her if she revealed the secret.
In mid-2019, the victim's mother noticed something amiss in her daughter and took her to a hospital where doctors found she was around six months pregnant.
After the victim told her mother what had happened, she called on local police to launch a criminal investigation.
In November 2019, the victim gave birth to a boy, DNA results confirming Thanh to be the father.
The Central Institute of Mental Forensics in the southern Dong Nai Province concluded the victim suffered intellectual disability with limited cognition and behavior control.

Vietnam to allow int'l soccer betting payments via e-wallets.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing to allow soccer and horse racing bettors to make payments via e-wallets, bank accounts or prepaid mobile phone accounts, as part of a new legal document, for which the ministry is seeking feedback, to replace a decree over betting on horse and dog racing and international soccer events.
The prevailing regulations allow people to only place bets via mobile phones and pay for betting tickets via bank accounts.
However, with the rapid growth in technology and cashless payment methods, it is essential to expand payment methods to create favorable conditions for bettors, the ministry explained.
Since each payment method has its own upside, bettors can opt to link their betting accounts with their bank accounts, e-wallets, or prepaid mobile phone subscriptions.
These payment methods can also help in terms of rewarding bettors, wherein they can get cash rewards transferred to their linked accounts by betting companies or agents and can withdraw the money in line with the prevailing regulations on e-payment.
The ministry suggested these payment accounts must be opened at cashless payment service providers or e-wallet operators in accordance with Vietnam's regulations on non-cash payment.
Moreover, as per existing regulations, the betting sum of money must be at least VND10,000 each time, and the daily maximum amount set for each player placing a bet at a certain betting firm is VND1 million.
Any change to the quota must be sent to the Government for consideration and approval.
Accordingly, the finance ministry suggested eliminating these betting limits.
Instead, under the new decree, the ministry should coordinate with the relevant ministries and agencies to present plans to the prime minister on betting limits for different periods.
Further, the Government leader should take additional responsibility for revising the betting limits for each period in the new decree, said the ministry.

Binh Chanh begins demolishing Tram Chim resort.
After a long period of suspension due to the Tet holiday and the coronavirus pandemic, Binh Chanh District in HCMC on June 23 restarted tearing down numerous facilities at Gia Trang Quan, also known as the Tram Chim Resort, which was illegally developed in Tan Quy Tay Commune.
A representative from the government of the commune told Thanh Nien Online that the large-scale commercial complex was developed on land which is for agricultural purposes only.
The demolition is aimed at forcing Tran Thi Minh Trang, the owner of the resort, to restore the status of the land covering an area of over 7,260 square meters.
The authorities had earlier demanded that Trang demolish the illegal portions of the resort but she remained defiant, the representative added.
At 8.00 a.m. today, a working team of 200 people and vehicles were dispatched to the resort for the demolition, which is expected to be completed within one week.
Tram Chim Resort, which was built in 2015, comprises 65 guest rooms, 16 karaoke rooms, 13 sauna rooms, and many other facilities.
Following a decision to demolish Tram Chim Resort, the Binh Chanh government on November 19, 2019, asked 17 individuals concerned to practice self-criticism as they failed to closely cooperate and address the illegal construction, thus prolonging the entire process.
When the Binh Chanh government began demolishing the construction work at the resort, Tran Thi Minh Trang filed a lawsuit against the district government and demanded that it revoke the Binh Chanh chairman’s decision demanding the illegal facilities at the resort be destroyed.
Trang said the demolition has caused heavy losses for her.
Calling for cryptocurrency investment is illegal.
A former top police official asked local residents to stay clear of persons calling for investments in cryptocurrencies to avoid being cheated, as drives to mobilize capital for the crypto business are unlawful in Vietnam.
Besides breaking Vietnamese laws, investors in cryptocurrencies could also face risks.
Cryptocurrencies or virtual money and payments made using such money are not legally recognized in the country, according to Vu Hoang Kien, former deputy head of the Criminal Police Department, under the Ministry of Public Security.
The police have cracked down on many crypto rings so far.
Many investors have been lured through the simple investment procedures and interest rate as high as 90% per month, and have been consequently defrauded for up to hundreds of billions of dong.
Some swindlers have even offered an astounding interest rate of 120% per month to attract investors.
Kien advised locals not to be tempted by the high-interest rates in the crypto business, as this could mean going against Vietnamese laws and lead to substantial debt for themselves, their families and friends.
According to Nguyen Nam Hao from the Police Department for Corruption, Smuggling, and Economic Crimes, despite the many warnings issued on the matter, many locals are still investing in cryptocurrencies.
To date, only the Government’s Decree 96 stipulates administrative fines at VND150 million-VND200 million for individuals that issue, supply, and use unlawful payment methods, including Bitcoins and other virtual currencies.

Heat wave forecast to hit central, northern regions.
Localities in the northern and central regions are expected to brace for a heatwave early this week, from June 22-24, with high temperatures likely rising up to 42 degrees Celsius in some areas.
These regions suffer the high temperatures due to the impact of a high heat pressure in the west which expands its scale to the southeast, coupled with Foehn wind, according to the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Weather Forecasting.
The hot wave will likely send the temperatures soaring above 35 degrees Celsius from 10 to 18 hours per day, in addition to the low humidity of 30%-50%.
Specifically, in the northwest region, the extreme weather could kick off high temperatures in the provinces of Son La and Hoa Binh at between 35 and 38 degrees Celsius, even above 39 degrees in some areas today, June 22.
As for the northeastern region and the capital city of Hanoi, local people could experience the hottest days with temperatures ranging between 36 and 39 degrees Celsius.
Meanwhile, thundery showers could spread across some areas in the Central Highlands and southern regions, with monsoon blowing at level three. Lightning, hail, and sudden squalls may happen during thundershowers.
AFF Cup format to remain unchanged despite Vietnam suggestion.
The ASEAN Football Federation has decided not to change the home-and-away format of the 2020 AFF Cup.
At an online AFF conference on June 11 the Vietnam Football Federation suggested the event should be played in just one or two countries if the Covid-19 pandemic is not controlled across the region by the end of this year.
In Vietnam, the outbreak has been controlled and there has been no community transmission for over two months, making it a favorite to be host or joint host if its proposal had been accepted.
Vietnam is also the defending champion.
But the AFF, after considering the suggestion, decided not to change the format, and teams will play each other at home and away just like the 2018 edition.
It said the 2022 World Cup qualifiers will also take place at the end of this year with their format unchanged, which is playing home and away matches, so it would be unreasonable for AFF to change the format of their event.

There is no evidence that Vietnamese customs officials have received bribes from Japanese company Tenma as alleged by Japanese news reports.
Deputy Director-General of Vietnam Customs Nguyen Duong Thai said Thursday that preliminary investigations have found no evidence that tax money was lost to alleged bribery by plastic appliances maker Tenma Vietnam.
Authorities are still investigating the allegation that the company, based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, bribed Vietnamese officials JPY25 million ($215000) to reduce its tax liability.

To avoid the tax, the company paid a senior customs official VND2 billion ($86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August 2019 Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, of JPY89 million ($826,400).

British pilot no longer needs lung transplant.
A lung transplant considered for Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot, is no longer necessary following a recovery.
Luong Ngoc Khue, head of the Ministry of Health's department of diagnosis and treatment, said Wednesday the 43-year-old man in HCMC, who beat Covid-19 after two months but remains under treatment due to lung infection, is now recovering well and can breathe on his own.
He's fully conscious and capable of coherent verbal communication, Khue said.
Sức mạnh cơ bắp chân tay và chức năng hô hấp của anh đã hồi phục.
In May, the health ministry considered a lung transplant for the British pilot as his condition at the time was much more severe.
Computed tomography scan results showed that fibrosis had solidified most of his lungs, and he constantly relied on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to stay alive.
But as his condition progressed, his lungs slowly got better. He was finally taken off ventilators last week, and has breathed on his own since.
He has now been in treatment for three months, the longest period for any Covid-19 patient in Vietnam.
The country has recorded 335 Covid-19 cases so far, with only ten active infections left and no deaths. It has gone over two months without community transmission.

Chinese contractor withdraws demand for US$50m for Hanoi railway project.
Following meetings between Chinese contractor China Railway 6 Bureau Group and the Vietnamese transport authority, the Chinese contractor has withdrawn its request of US$50 million for the operation of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi.
The Vietnamese transport authority fully understands the obstacles encountered by the Chinese contractor but the payment of this sum of money is unjustifiable.
The Vietnamese side only makes payments based on the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract and in line with Vietnam’s laws, said Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Ngoc Dong.
In addition, the transport ministry has requested the relevant agencies to expedite the project so it can be put into service this year, as requested by the prime minister.
Regarding the return of Chinese personnel to Vietnam after travel restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased, Deputy Minister Dong confirmed that 28 Chinese experts have arrived in Vietnam.
The remaining 100 Chinese personnel are following certain procedures to return to the country.
The Chinese experts are expected to enter Vietnam by train through the northern province of Lao Cai.
Upon arrival, they must make health declarations, undergo health checkups and be disinfected before moving to Hanoi to be quarantined for 14 days.
Aside from them, three French consulting experts are yet to arrive in Vietnam due to the travel restrictions. The Transport Ministry is working with the Vietnamese Embassy in France to facilitate their return.
According to the transport official, the French experts play a crucial role in the project, and the trial operation of the railway depends on the evaluation of the French team.

Ministry considers postponing school opening day to August 15.
The Ministry of Education and Training is considering deferring the first day of the 2020-2021 school year until August 15 instead of August 1 and extending the summer vacation for students, according to the VnExpress news site.
According to the initial plan, the first day of school for kindergartens, high schools and vocational schools was slated for August 1, 2020.
The opening ceremony for the new school year would be held on September 5, 2020.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 2019-2020 academic year will end on July 15, one and a half months later than scheduled.
Therefore, if the 2020-2021 academic year begins on August 1 as initially planned, the summer vacation will only be for two weeks.
Although the 2019-2020 school year is scheduled to end on July 15, some provinces and cities such as Nghe An have accelerated the study program to end the school year before July, thus ensuring students enjoy a longer vacation.
In Hanoi, senior high schools such as Nguyen Du and Trung Vuong are holding the final exams for students, while Nguyen Tat Thanh High School and HUS High School for Gifted Students have already ended the 2019-2020 school year.

Pilot error reason for Vietjet plane skidding off runway.
The aviation incident involving a Vietjet passenger aircraft skidding off a runway in HCMC last weekend as serious, Transport Minister Nguyen Van The noted that it was mainly the fault of the pilot.
Amid the heavy downpour and strong winds on Sunday afternoon, the pilot should have accurately evaluated the weather conditions before landing to ensure safety.
He received instructions from air traffic controllers while landing, but he has the right to decide whether to land or not.
He could have asked for permission to divert the plane and land at another airport, the minister told the local media on the sidelines of the ninth session of the 14th National Assembly on June 15.
The official noted that an investigation team from the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) would decode the plane’s black box to determine why the pilot decided to touch down amid the poor weather conditions.
Commenting on a CAAV press release stating that the weather was the leading cause of the incident, Minister The said the CAAV investigators would work to determine the exact cause of the accident and announce their final decision.
The two foreign pilots operating the plane that skidded off the runway have been suspended from service and their licenses have been seized pending the investigation.

Vietjet pilots’ licenses seized after the accident.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has suspended two foreign pilots from work and seized their licenses after a Vietjet aircraft skidded off the runway while landing in HCMC yesterday afternoon.
It also suspended six flight attendants and formed a team to investigate the incident.
However, the aircraft was not pulled to the airport’s apron until 8:30 p.m. on the day as technical staff had to elevate the plane to replace its blown-out tyre and conduct other checks.
The incident affected hundreds of flights to and from the airport.
According to a captain who is a flight instructor, similar landing incidents have occurred during bad weather conditions such as heavy rain and strong winds.
The captain explained that the pilot could have been unable to control the plane in the right direction due to the heavy downpour and tailwind, leading to it sliding off the runway.
Moreover, if the pilot suddenly hits the brakes, it could cause possible damage to the nose gear and the plane can skid off the runway as a result.
Early this morning, the plane was towed away from the scene of the incident.

Solar eclipse next week to be visible in Vietnam.
Vietnam will see part of an annular eclipse, commonly referred to as a "ring of fire," on June 21.
People in Hanoi can see 71 percent of the eclipse and those in Ho Chi Minh City, 36 percent.
The eclipse will begin in Vietnam at 1:16 p.m.

The second, a total eclipse on December 14, will be visible from South America.
A solar eclipse occurs when the disk of the moon appears to cross in front of the disk of the sun.
An annular eclipse occurs when the sun appears as a bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the moon.
The last solar eclipse seen in Vietnam was an annular eclipse on December 26 last year.
Scientists have sounded the warning: sky watchers should only see the eclipse indirectly or with proper glasses to prevent retinal burns.
HCMC hires private firm to build 372 ASEAN standard restrooms.
A private company has struck deals to build and maintain 372 restrooms of ASEAN Public Toilet Standards at many public spots in HCMC.
In return for its investment, estimated at around VND500 million ($21,500) for each facility, the company will be allowed to set up and run a convenience store in the vicinity.
Agreements to this effect have been reached between district authorities and the city-based Tien Phong Tech JSC.
Of the total, 283 restrooms will be established at spots chosen by districts, and 89 at bus stations.
So far, several restrooms of this type have been set up on a pilot basis around the city, including one at the corner of Tu Xuong and Cach Mang Thang Tam streets in District 3.
The restroom is a stainless steel affair with doors that open by pressing a button and close automatically after the user has entered the cabin.
Inside it is equipped with soap, hand sanitizer, and hand dryer, all designed to operate automatically.
One cabin covers a floor area of 70 square meters.
The investor is allowed to open a booth to sell convenience goods next to the restroom to recover the investment capital.
The restrooms are designed and produced exclusively by Tien Phong Tech.
The surrounding areas of the toilet should be kept clean, safe and provide easy access for visitors, and the exterior and interior design can either use traditional or modern architecture.
Each facility should have at least one toilet for the disabled with bigger doors for wheel chair access and railings for support.
HCMC has assigned district-level authorities to approve private investments in public toilets and cut the time taken for processing it.
Last month, the municipal environment department issued a guidance document saying that the authorities will provide land plots for the investors to set up public restrooms, and in return, the investors will be allowed to run certain services alongside to recover their investment.

Vietnam begins importing live pigs from Thailand.
Vietnam has given the green light for the import of pigs from Thailand for the purposes of both farming and slaughter from June 12 to bring down domestic pork prices that have skyrocketed due to the scarcity caused by the African swine fever epidemic.
Thailand was chosen as the supplier as its wholesale prices of hogs currently range between VND55,000 and VND60,000 per kilo, lower than Vietnam’s current prices averaging VND95,000 per kilogram.
Pham Tran Sum, director of Viet Duc International Nutrition Company, informed Nguoi Lao Dong Online that the firm is finalizing dossiers for the import of pigs for slaughter in Vietnam and is expected to receive the first batch of 2,000 pigs early next week.
Following the information, local pig prices dropped slightly to VND86,000 to VND87,000 per kilo.
When Thai pork is launched in the market, domestic prices may fall to below VND85,000 a kilo, Sum noted.
On June 11, Agriculture and Rural Development Deputy Minister Phung Duc Tien tasked the Animal Health Department with issuing detailed guidelines on quarantine measures for the imported pigs in line with existing regulations to prevent diseases and ensure the safety of domestic herds.
The department director is also responsible for ensuring coordination with inter-sector agencies at ports of entry and local authorities to strictly manage the live imports.

VinFast opens office in Australia.
Vietnamese carmaker VinFast has entered the Australian market by opening a research and development center in Melbourne on June 11 as part of its strategic plan to go global.
VinFast Australia is located next to Melbourne’s Financial and Economic Center and Monash University, in addition to many large-scale research facilities.
Such a prime location is convenient for research development and business activities.
The Australia-based office will research and develop new automobile models including gasoline-driven and electric cars, as well as lay the foundation for the carmaker’s global expansion, realizing its goal to become a global car brand by connecting with leading suppliers.
The new office employs some one hundred official employees, who are high-profile experts and engineers from the world's leading automobile corporations such as GM, Toyota, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover.
Being considered a “headquarters” of many major car manufacturers including Toyota, Ford, Mitsubishi and GM, Melbourne has several existing facilities, supply chains and manpower with a wealth of experience in the automobile industry.
VinFast, a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup, tested its first electric car in the capital city of Hanoi late last month to prepare for the new model’s debut by the end of the year.
The carmaker is set to launch the new electric model at the Los Angeles Auto Show in the United States in November.
Virtual jokes, real consequences.
Last month, news about actor Tran Thanh taking drugs with some of his celebrity friends were simmering among Vietnamese netizens.
The information was posted on Facebook with screenshots of a conversation between a group of friends.
Several hours later, the "joke" post was removed after thousands of people had viewed it.
The actor, an accidental victim of online rumors, decided to meet the women responsible for the post, in the presence of his lawyer.
"I do not know you.
You made up a story and spread it on the Internet, that is intentionally wrong,"  Trấn Thành told the supposed culprits last week.
Tran Thanh is among dozens of Vietnamese celebrities suddenly faced with the hurdles of rumors and misinformation spread via social media.
Death hoaxes are some of the most popular tricks.
Two months ago, a Facebooker posted photos of model Truong My Nhan depicting a deadly traffic accident, causing netizens to think her dead.
In 2018, singer Nhat Kim Anh was said to be a drug addict and "sleep with every man in showbiz.".
Kim Anh had to ask local police to investigate the woman responsible for the rumor.
Celebrities are the first victims of news about themselves spread on the Internet, which can cause scandals and directly affect their commercial activities.
According to actor Tran Thanh, 10 companies he has collaborated with asked for an explanation last week after rumors about him using drugs made the virtual airwaves.
Two other brands halted negotiations over new advertising contracts.
How can they sign a contract if my reputation is ruined? It affects my life and family, Tran Thanh said.
Many artists have shared their frustration and worries, including actor Van Anh and his wife who were said to be divorced after faking their marriage.
In April, local government decided to slap fines on those who post false, slanderous or lurid content online.
A new decree regulates fines of between VND10-20 million ($434 - 868) for taking advantage of social networks to provide fake information, slander or insult agencies and organizations, and lower the honor or dignity of individuals.
Trấn Thành has asked his lawyer to consider suing those who made up the rumors and report the case to local police.
In 2015, Hanoi police apprehended Tran Thi Huong Giang, 37, residing in Ba Dinh District, after she created several Facebook accounts to post and share fake news on local celebrities, calling it "truth conveying.".
The truth is, about half of Hanoi and Saigon residents encounter fake news at least once a week, according to a survey by Indochina Research last year.
Many are concerned about the impact of misinformation on their daily lives.
Rumors about celebrities, spread with the speed of light on the Internet.
The women accusing actor Tran Thanh of sniffing cocaine on Facebook said they were making a joke and apologized.
Meanwhile, the person spreading rumors about singer Nhat Kim Anh tried to deny her actions, saying her account was hacked.
Tran Thanh is the first Vietnamese celeb to take legal action against those sharing rumors about his personal life, with support from colleagues, many of whom had previously chosen to keep silent.
Proposal to allow five days off for National Day holiday rejected.
Minister of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs Dao Ngoc Dung has given multiple reasons for rejecting a proposal to increase the number of days off to five for Vietnam's National Day holiday on September 2.
Minister Dung told the local media on the sidelines of the ongoing sitting of the 14th National Assembly on June 10 that even though the proposal is aimed at boosting the tourism sector, it is necessary to carefully consider other aspects and assess its impact.
This year, National Day is in the middle of the week, leading to a wide gap between the holiday and the weekend, he noted, adding that receiving compensation for the days off is unreasonable.
Over the past few months, as Vietnam adopted various Covid-19 prevention and control measures and issued the social distancing order, employees and students have had several weeks off.
It is now high time for the country to both prevent and fight the coronavirus and focus on getting the manufacturing sector back on track and recovering the labor market to foster economic growth.
The Government can only allow the two million public employees to take days off for the holiday, a trivial number compared with the 55 million active laborers.
If the prime minister passes the proposal, the tourism sector will not see significant benefits, said Minister Dung.
Apart from this, between September 3 and 5, students normally start their new academic year.
For these reasons, the ministry and I have objected to the proposal to allow five days off for the upcoming national day holiday.
I had discussed the proposal with the prime minister and he agreed with my opinion, said Minister Dung.
Tourism authorities had previously proposed that the Government extend the National Day holiday on September 2 by four days to stimulate the tourism sector after Covid-19.

Butterflies taste with their feet.
A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.
They have taste sensors on their feet, and by standing on a leaf, they can taste it to see if their caterpillars can eat it.
Most adult butterflies can't bite or chew.
They eat mainly liquids like nectar, sap, juices from fruits, etc.
The blue whale's whistle is the loudest noise!
Blue whales mostly emit very loud, highly structured, repetitive low-frequency rumbling sounds that can travel for many miles underwater.
These songs may be used for communicating with other blue whales, especially in order to attract and find mates.
The call of the blue whale reaches levels up to 188 decibels.
This extraordinarily loud whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles underwater.
Theoretical calculations by Roger Payne and Douglas Webb (from the 1970′s) predicted that the loudest whale sounds might be transmitted across an entire ocean.
The blue whale is much louder than a jet, which reaches only 140 decibels! Human shouting is 70 decibels. sounds over 120 decibels are painful to human ears.
Mosquitoes are attracted to the color blue twice as much as to any other colors.
There are two kinds of Pandas.
Did you know there are two kinds of panda? There is a long-tailed Himalayan carnivore that looks like a raccoon and there is a giant panda bear that lives in Western China.
Slug have four noses.
Although they don't have the same type ofrespiratory system that the humanbeing has so their nose performs a different function to ours.
But they do have appendages that can sense heat and other stimuli, in other words they have 4 sensory organs where there nose looks like it should be.
But no actual nose.
Russian pilot falls into cliff when paragliding in Yen Bai.
A Russian pilot has met with an accident and fallen into the cliff from the height of 20 meters when joining the 2020 paragliding festival held in Mu Cang Chai District in the northwestern province of Yen Bai.
A grassroots officer of Mu Cang Chai's Cao Pha Commune confirmed on June 2 that the accident happened on May 30, the local media reported.
After a few seconds of taking off, the male pilot's paraglider teetered and fell into the cliff.
The leader of Cao Pha Commune said that the pilot flew the paraglider in a wrong way, leading to the unexpected fall.
The victim sustained minor back injury in the accident and is receiving treatment at Viet Duc Hospital in Hanoi City.
The paragliding festival taking place on Saturdays and Sundays from May 30 to July 15 is aimed at introducing tourism images of Yen Bai.
Local gasoline price could rise sharply tomorrow.
Local fuel wholesalers forecast that the gasoline price in the local market will rise some VND1,000 per liter tomorrow, June 12, following an upsurge in global petrol prices over the last 15 days.
Data from the Ministry of Industry and Trade revealed that the prices of RON92 and RON95 gasoline traded in Singapore's market as of June 8 were US$39.25 and US$42.16 per barrel, respectively, both up 19% against the previous 15-day period.
Oil prices also soared to US$42 per barrel.
A fuel merchant in HCMC said that local fuel traders have been suffering losses since their commission was sharply reduced, while the global fuel prices have been seeing an upward trend these days.
Accordingly, local fuel prices may be revised upward in line with the global market price.
Based on the global increment level, oil and gasoline prices in the local market are expected to edge up by VND800-VND1,000 per liter if the national fuel stabilization fund is untapped, the merchant said.
A representative of a fuel firm in Hanoi said that tomorrow will possibly mark the third consecutive time that local fuel prices are set to rise sharply since April 28.
He predicted that local oil and petrol prices will edge up some VND500-VND600 per liter.
Bulgarian jailed for stealing bank account data.
Stamov Ruslan Todorvo, 37, entered Vietnam last October and stayed in Ho Chi Minh City's District 7.
He frequented several ATMs of different banks to install a device which could collect PIN numbers and other card information, allowing him to collect bank card numbers when someone used an ATM, local media reported.
From October 7 to October 11 last year, several banks found that some of their customers' accounts had been compromised and the money withdrawn from different ATMs in the city.
Investigating police found that Todorvo was part of a Bulgarian group who had been stealing bank card information and using it to steal money with fake ATM cards that they made with another device.
Todorvo was detained October 10 when he went to the Tan Son Nhat Airport to leave Vietnam.
Police found that his laptop contained data from 121 bank accounts, including 98 from Vietnamese banks and the rest from outside the country.
According to info provided by several banks, at least 10 customers have been robbed off around VND87.5 million ($3,780) in total.
Their account information was found in Todorvo's laptop.
He denied accusations that he had stolen the money.
No information on other members in his group has been revealed.
Cancer-causing Ingredient in Chili Peppers Soothed by Ginger.
It's widely thought that ginger has health benefits — one of which may be to protect against an ingredient in chili peppers that has been linked to stomach cancer.
Both ginger and chili peppers are commonly used in Asian cuisine.
Chili peppers get their kick from capsaicin, which some research suggests also has plenty of health benefits.
But a diet rich in capsaicin has also been linked to stomach cancer.
Now, new research shows that one compound in ginger appears to offset the negative health effects of the chili pepper ingredient, and that used together, the two compounds might actually inhibit cancer growth.
Researchers at Pharmacy College of Henan University in China conducted a study with mice prone to lung cancer.
Over the course of several weeks, they fed the mice either capsaicin or 6-gingerol or both.
China surprises economists with GDP rise of 7%.
Following weeks of stock market turmoil, China has confounded expectations that its economic growth would slow further in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising by 7%.
Analysts had widely predicted that economic growth would dip from 7% in the first quarter to around 6.8% in the second.
However, GDP held steady, officials from China's National Bureau of Statistics claimed on Wednesday morning.
The figure still represents the lowest level of growth since the 2009 global financial crisis but is in line with Beijing's official target for 2015 of around 7%.
The announcement of stable second quarter growth surprised analysts, offered a boost to Beijing's attempts to soften the country's economic slowdown and came after weeks of chaos in the Chinese stock market which saw more than $3tn wiped off shares.
However, there were immediate doubts over the growth figure's reliability with the announcement sparking renewed debate over the trustworthiness of Beijing's statistics.
China's premier, Li Keqiang, tried to put a brave face on the recent stock market collapse during a meeting on Friday with economists and business leaders in Beijing.
However, Beijing has faced criticism for its handling of the crash.
Chinese president Xi Jinping has vowed to reduce Beijing's role in the economy but as stocks plunged earlier this month the Communist party took drastic measures, including temporarily halting initial public offerings.

Local Internet security firm Bkav on June 10 announced its plan to manufacture low-cost mobile phones priced at less than VND1 million.
The production of the Bkav Smart Feature Phone 4G-C85 is aimed at supplying the local market with cell phones with 4G Internet connections at affordable prices.
The economical cell phones are set to be rolled out in July.
Unlike Bphone, which is a smartphone Bkav had earlier launched in the market and was designed in terms of style and software by the firm, the Bkav Smart Feature Phone 4G will be produced in the form of original design manufacturing.
The new cell phones will run on the KaiOS operating system.
To offer the Bkav Smart Feature Phone 4G at less than VND1 million, Bkav will join hands with a major telecom carrier to subsidize the price, said Nguyen Ba Co, sales manager of Bkav.
The firm's cooperation with the telecom carrier is expected to expand its manufacturing operations to serve various customers, he added.
he noted, Bkav has been selling mid- and high-end products, so it is about time the firm entered into the low-cost cell phone segment.
Illegal hormone supply places transgender Vietnamese at risk.
To An has spent the last decade reliant on feminizing hormones smuggled to Vietnam after her gender reassignment surgery (GRS).
I consulted several hospitals in Saigon, but was rejected due to a lack of professionalism.
I was stuck and considered suicide, To An recalled.
In 2009, a gay man from Thailand told her about a medicine that could give users smoother skin, develop their breasts, and stop facial hair from growing.
After receiving her order, To An asked a friend to help her with the injection, not considering the side effects.
According to the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI), there are around 300,000 to 500,000 transgender Vietnamese, with 70 percent using hormones purchased from acquaintances, the Internet, or, like To An, the black market.
There is no pharmacy or medical facility providing hormone therapy to transgender Vietnamese, who have to rely on unprescribed hormones that often cause a host of side-effects.
Most miracle effect testosterone and estrogen hormones are imported illegally from Thailand, Germany, and India, their origins completely unknown.
In the past three months, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen international flights to Vietnam halted, leaving transgender Vietnamese in the lurch.
According to To An, many of her friends, who seldom stockpile hormones, are currently reliant on birth control pills.
The lack of supply is only one dilemma.
For many years, To An's friends have helped her inject hormones, mostly on a trial-and-error basis.
Once, following an injection in her buttock that caught infection, she had to be rushed to hospital for life-saving surgery, leaving her body permanently scarred.
After a near bleed-out, Truc Quan, 21, has been self-injecting estrogen bought online for eight months, extremely conscious of the many risks involved.
According to Doctor Nguyen Van Phung, plastic surgery lecturer at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam has no laws governing hormone therapy or GRS for its transgender populace.
Common side-effects of hormone injection include embolism, osteoporosis, hypertension, and allergy.
Using unprescribed medication can be even more dangerous.
If facing complications related to hormone treatment or GRS, transgender citizens should immediately attend hospital, the doctor stressed.
Quan, having learnt her lesson, now periodically visits a clinic to receive a hormone injection.
she said, I hope my friends learn about the side-effects of hormone treatment, find a doctor, or someone with a medical background to assist them.

PM approves reopening of karaoke parlors, dance clubs.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has given the green light to reopen karaoke parlors and dance clubs across the country as Vietnam has managed to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
Addressing a Government meeting this morning, June 9, Phuc tasked the Ministry of Public Security and relevant agencies with tightening control on violations and crimes at karaoke parlors and dance clubs after they reopen, especially the trade and use of heroin.
To help the tourism and aviation sectors recover, the prime minister asked the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control to identify countries or regions that have not reported new Covid-19 cases over the past 30 days so that Vietnam can resume flights to these regions.
Ministries, government departments and local authorities should still be watchful, especially in border areas, at border gates and at airports, Phuc said.
Karaoke parlors and dance clubs are the last nonessential services allowed to reopen.
Other nonessential services such as beauty salons, barbershops, and gyms have been reopened since May 7.
As of this afternoon, Vietnam had reported no new Covid-19 cases in the community for 54 consecutive days.
National Day holiday extension proposed as tourism boost.
The Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) has suggested that this year's National Day holiday in September be extended from Wednesday to the weekend.
This year, the national holiday falls on a Wednesday, and many localities and over 30 businesses have said the holiday could be extended for the rest of that week to commemorate the 75th National Day and promote domestic tourism, VNAT head Nguyen Trung Khanh said on Tuesday.
Ha Tat Thang, head of the Department of Labor Safety, which is an advisory agency for annual holidays under the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, said he has not received any official document with such a suggestion from the tourism sector.
Recovering from the epidemic, all businesses want to focus on restoring production.
Each sector will have its own direction, but everything should serve the same interest, he said, adding that he would discuss the proposal with the labor ministry once he receives an official document.
Whether the holiday would be extended or not would be decided by the government, he said.
Of a total of 14 public holidays in Vietnam this year, there's only one left, which is the National Day.
Starting 2021, Vietnamese will enjoy an extra day off for the National Day holiday, either on September 1 or September 3.

Northern Vietnam faces the longest heat wave in 27 years.
A heat wave impacting Hanoi and northern provinces since May 31 is expected to become the longest to have hit the region in over two decades.
High temperatures in northern provinces like Lang Son, Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Hai Duong, Hung Yen, Ha Nam, and Ninh Binh were recorded at 39 degrees Celsius on Monday while those in Hanoi and Hoa Binh reached 40 degrees Celsius, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
The heat wave is forecast to linger until June 13 and may become the longest to have hit northern Vietnam since 1993.
Nguyen Van Huong, head of the weather forecasting department at the center, said widespread heat waves since 1993 had only lasted five to seven days.
The average temperatures in northern localities in the coming days are expected to reach 36 to 39 degrees Celsius.
American forecast services provider AccuWeather said the temperature in Hanoi would reach 38 degrees Celsius and remains at 35-36 until this weekend.
At 1 p.m Monday, all monitoring stations recorded temperatures above 37 with a scorching hot sun.
The highest is Lang area at 39, Ha Dong District at 38.5, Hoai Duc and Son Tay Districts at 38.
The heat wave was caused by low-pressure areas from the west and the Foehn wind, a type of dry, warm and down-slope wind that occurs in the lee of a mountain range, Huong said.
Experts have advised residents to avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 10 a.m and 3 p.m and to wear sunscreen, sunglasses and brimmed hats if venturing out under the sun.
Central Vietnam has been impacted by similar scorching weather over the past 10 days.
The heat is expected to continue in the region until June 16.
It is quite common for a heat wave to last 17 to 18 days in central Vietnam.
The most intense heat wave to have struck the region occurred in 2015, lasting for up to 39 days.
The National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting has warned of high risks of fire and explosion at local residential areas and forests due to the hot and dry weather.
Vietnam has been going through scorching days since early May.
On May 21, Hanoi's Ha Dong District experienced a record 40.9 degrees Celsius, the highest May temperature since 1961.
On the same day, parts of Lao Cai, Hoa Binh and Ha Giang also recorded their highest May temperatures in decades.
Last year, Vietnam went through possibly the hottest summer in history with average temperatures 0.5-1 degrees Celsius higher than previously, climbing to an average 39-42 degrees Celsius in many parts of the country.
The nation broke its highest temperature record on April 20 as the mercury hit 43.4 degrees Celsius, or 110 degrees Fahrenheit, in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province in central Vietnam.
Vietnam could host AFF Cup on its own.
Vietnam could end up hosting the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Cup 2020 on its own thanks to its effective handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) General Secretary Le Hoai Anh affirmed last weekend that a single host was one of the options being considered by the AFF.
In an official announcement last week, the ASEAN federation affirmed that it won't be postponing the championship until 2021 as earlier planned, and the tournament will take place from November 25 to December 31, soon after the World Cup 2022 qualifiers.
The AFF Cup had introduced the new format of having home and away matches for each team from the group stage to the final in 2018.
Anh said Vietnam has not received any official notice from the AFF about changing the tournament format, but added that anything can happen in the current situation.
If the AFF Cup opts to have the tournament played in just one country, Vietnam stands a great chance to host it because it would be considered a safe location after its demonstrated success in containing the pandemic.
Vietnam is the only country in Southeast Asia to have restarted its football tournaments and opened up stadiums for spectators.
The National Cup commenced May 23, making it the first football tournament to make a comeback after Vietnam eased its social distancing campaigns late April.
The match between Duoc Nam Ha Nam Dinh (Nam Dinh FC) and Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL FC) saw 10,000 spectators fill half of the Thien Truong Stadium in Nam Dinh Province, an event that made international headlines.

Mount Kilauea, the world's most active volcanic mass in the U.S, and Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain.
Son Doong is estimated to be between 400 and 450 million years old, but it was only discovered in 2009.
The cave, which has a total length of 9 kilometers, was declared as the world's largest and it opened to tourists in 2013, four years after members of the British Cave Research Association finished their exploration.
Now, Son Doong, part of the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, a UNESCO heritage site, is a fast-emerging tourist destination in the country.

In the past, the lantern festival was a tradition that often organized for royal families.
However, concerns about the protection of ancient architecture - mostly made of wood - from fire, have made this tradition no longer exist.

Vietnamese pop singers are interested in traditional topics.
Vietnamese pop singers are broaching traditional topics in a brave new way, sparking off lively debates.
The two most notable recent songs are by Hoa Minzy and Bich Phuong.
Hoa Minzy's ambitious nine-minute ballad musical video titled Khong The Cung Nhau Suot Kiep (Can't Be Together Forever) provides a glimpse into the historical, gender-charged love story between Vietnam's last emperor, Bao Dai, and his wife, Empress Nam Phuong.
Nam Phuong was wedded to Bao Dai in an unprecedented marriage which required but didn't receive permission from the Roman Catholic Church because she was a Catholic and he was not.
She was consecrated as empress or the emperor's first wife right away, a patriarchal honor rarely bestowed on the concubines of the Nguyen Dynasty.
Nam Phuong went on to have five children with her husband.
Bao Dai, however, had other wives as well as extramarital affairs.
It is Nam Phuong's reaction upon discovering her husband's change of heart that is artistically treated in Hoa Minzy's MV.
Released on YouTube on May 13, Không Thể Cùng Nhau Suốt Kiếp has been widely lauded for its meticulous directing and scripting.
Within three days the MV went on to become the No.1 clip on YouTube Vietnam's Top Trending after attracting over 10 million views.
It has now garnered over 22 million views, many more likes than dislikes, and a lot of positive comments.
Hoang Thuy Linh has a bunch of EDM songs that make creative use of Vietnamese culture such as her 2019 hit De Mi Noi Cho Ma Nghe (Let Mi Tell You), which was inspired by 20th-century writer To Hoai's short story Vo Chong A Phu (A Phu and His Wife) about a couple living in the northwestern mountains during the French resistance.
Many MVs find inspiration in Vietnamese history, literature and folk culture has become a clever strategy for Vietnamese singers.

Fruit exporters hit by rising air freight costs.
Vietnamese fruit exporters are struggling since air freight costs are surging due to the limited number of flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Global Fresh Fruit Company Ltd of Ben Tre Province has seen exports fall by half in the last two months despite high demand from overseas buyers.
Its CEO, Phung Van Hien, said logistics companies are demanding two to four times the freight they did at the end of 2019.
Rates for shipping to the Middle East have surged from $1.5-1.8 per kilogram to $6, and freight to Australia has also increased, he said.
Nguyen Dinh Tung, CEO of Vina T&T, one of the largest Vietnamese exporters of fruits to the U.S, told local media the cost of shipping has increased from the regular $3.2 to $5.4.

Vietnam's fruit exports this year are down 21 percent to $1.1 billion, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Exporters have been turning to shipment by sea, but this is only suitable for fruits that do not perish soon like coconut, durian, and dragon fruit.
Fruits such as longan and lychee cannot endure long shipping durations.
Exports of vegetables and fruits were worth $3.7 billion last year, with China being the largest buyer, according to the ministry.
JICA inspects progress of HCMC's first metro line.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is funding HCMC's first metro line, held a meeting with the HCMC Management Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR) on June 3 to discuss the progress of the project.
The JICA delegation, led by Junko Takahashi, senior representative at the JICA Vietnam Office, and MAUR leaders also discussed the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, capital disbursement, the financial situation and the implementation of contracts for major packages of the metro line that will link Ben Thanh Market in District 1 and Suoi Tien Theme Park in District 9.
Addressing the meeting, Bui Xuan Cuong, director of MAUR, thanked JICA for its support and asked the agency to continue cooperating with the authority over major tasks for 2020 including capital disbursement, refunding payments and dealing with the challenges caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.
Cuong also requested the Japanese Government to assist Vietnam in importing trains for the metro line and the travel of Japanese experts to the country.
Work on the 19.7-kilometer metro line began in August 2012.
The line has 2.6 kilometers of underground track and over 17 kilometers of the elevated track as well as three underground and 11 elevated stations.
The metro line is more than 70% complete, and MAUR said it is accelerating the progress of components such as the installation of the tracks, lighting and signal systems and equipment at the stations.
It expects to complete 85% of the metro line by the end of this year and put it into service in late 2021.
British Covid-19 patient is fully conscious.
Vietnam's most severe case of Covid-19, the 91st patient, is fully conscious and able to respond to all instructions from health workers, said a representative from HCMC's Cho Ray Hospital, where the patient is being treated.
The British patient, who works as a pilot for the national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, smiled when health workers were interacting with him.
He could also feebly nod and shake the hands of the health workers, the hospital representative said at 7 p.m on June 2.
According to doctors at the hospital, his respiratory functions have gradually improved, while his kidney functions have also recovered.
His blood oxygen level remains stable.
The doctors have weaned him off an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine for two days, which is a life support machine used when a patient's heart and lungs fail to function properly.
However, he has to rely on a ventilator.
As for the patient's lungs, more than half of his left lung has almost recovered, while the right lung is showing signs of improvement.
The hospital representative said that the patient would continue to take antibiotics to treat his infection from Burkholderia cenocepacia, a type of bacteria, as well as to prevent other bacterial infections.
He has also begun physical therapy.
As of 6 a.m on June 3, Vietnam has reported no new Covid-19 cases caused via community transmission for 48 days.

Vietnam launches second mobile virtual network operator.
A second mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) called Reddi was introduced to the local market on June 3 by operator Mobicast, with the 055 prefix.
The network will use the mobile phone infrastructure of the State-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) to offer services to its customers.
To date, there are five traditional mobile network carriers in the country, namely Viettel, MobiFone, VNPT, Vietnamobile and Gtel.
As the latest addition to the local mobile network market, Reddi stressed that it would target young and modern customers and offer them telecom and digital services through mobile apps.
Reddi will not offer services at competitive prices but will focus on the customer experience.
The operator Mobicast noted that it would coordinate with digital service providers to offer Reddi customers new and personalized technology services.
One year ago, the country's first mobile virtual network called ITelecom was introduced with the numeral prefix 087.
At the launch ceremony, its operator Dong Duong Telecom Company said ITelecom would tap the niche market and provide mobile network services to workers in industrial zones.
However, ITelecom has not released its business performance results since the launch.
Data from the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications revealed that there are some 126 million mobile subscriptions in Vietnam but the average revenue earned from each subscription remains low at some VND100,000 per month.
Accordingly, experts in the field said the current fierce competitive market does not leave much room for mobile virtual networks to grow.
Le Dang Dung, chairman of military-run telecom carrier Viettel, told the Saigon Times that MVNOs see success only in European countries where the average revenue generated from each mobile subscription is high.
In Vietnam, MVNOs will struggle to compete with existing traditional mobile network operators since the average expenditures on mobile services in Vietnam are already low at VND70,000-VND90,000 per month.
Moreover, MVNOs can only survive when traditional mobile network carriers have yet to own widespread sales channels.
In reality, local telecom carriers have established their business operations nationwide with a large number of both offline and online stores, he added.
MPS steps up investigation into bribery case at Tenma.
The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) has ordered the Bac Ninh Province police to work with Japanese firm Tenma in the investigation of a bribery scandal involving 25 million yen to escape tax duties.
Speaking at a regular Government press briefing on June 2, Major General To An Xo, head of the office of the ministry, said that the prime minister had directed the Ministries of Finance and Public Security to launch a thorough probe into the case.
While the investigation is being conducted by the Ministry of Finance, the MPS has asked the Bac Ninh police to verify the information and collect the relevant paperwork and documentary evidence, Xo said.
The ministry also requested several relevant agencies to contact the Japanese firm over paperwork related to the case, the local media reported.
Under the prime minister's directive, investigation into the bribery case must be conducted in a transparent manner to prevent tax losses, noted the major general.
Earlier, several Japanese media outlets including Asahi, Kyodo and Nikkei had reported that Vietnamese officials accepted 25 million yen or VND5 billion in bribes from the Vietnam unit of the Tokyo-based company.
Minister of Finance Dinh Tien Dung on May 26 ordered the suspension of tax and customs officials implicated in the bribery case involving Tenma Vietnam, a subsidiary of Japan's plastic product maker Tenma Corporation, leading to 11 officials being suspended for 15 days pending the probe.
Late disbursement said to be reason for Chinese contractor's capital demand.
The Chinese contractor stated that the late disbursement of funds in the Cat Linh-Ha Dong railway project prompted it to demand US$50 million to pay the subcontractors and experts.
On June 3, Tang Hong, director of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong metro project, said that since February, the capital disbursement for the project was yet to be done, hindering the Chinese contractor from paying the subcontractors.
While most of the project equipment has been completed, Hong noted that the payment for the workload was yet to be made, VnExpress news site reported.
The Chinese contractor asked the Railway Project Management Unit to pay US$50 million, in line with the provisions of the contract at an online meeting in May so that it could make payments to contractors, subcontractors and experts while operating the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway on a trial basis.
This is the payment for the construction workload in accordance with the engineering, procurement and construction contract but not the increased costs, Hong said.
Meanwhile, Vu Hong Phuong, director of the Railway Project Management Unit, said that the documents sent to the unit by the Chinese contractor were not eligible, so the unit could not make any payment.
Lower growth trend brews for Vietnam beer industry.
Vietnam's strict implementation of drunk driving laws and other factors will dampen the beer market this year.
A recent report by the Vietnam Industry Research And Consultancy (VIRAC) says this will be a trend in coming years despite the fact that a million people become newly eligible to consume alcohol each year.
The report estimates an annual growth of 6-7 percent for the domestic beer industry.
It notes that the industry's stock value dropped by nearly 13 percent last year and says small businesses are likely to be most affected by the drop in growth.
In 2019, Vietnam consumed more than 4.6 billion liters of beer, an increase of more than 10 percent over the previous year.
According to Germany-based data portal Statista, beer sales revenue rose 6.88 percent year-on-year to around $7.75 billion.
The main reason for the industry slump is Decree 100, which took effect on January 1 this year, imposing stiff penalties for drunk driving.
Those riding bicycles and electric bikes will also be fined for this.
Motorcyclists and car drivers can be fined VND6-8 million and VND30-40 million ($1,300-1,725), double the old levels and have their licenses suspended for 22-24 months.
Covid-19 pandemic is also said to likely contribute to slower growth this year.
The reports noted that Vietnam's export markets, including China and Southeast Asian countries, are experiencing high growth in food and beverage consumption.
Equatorial Guinea in Africa is Vietnam's biggest export market, accounting for 20 percent.
Vietnam's export beer output in 2019 is estimated at 46 million liters valued at $45.87 million.
Big C Mien Dong to close down.
Thailand's Central Retail, which manages and operates the Big C supermarket chain in Vietnam, announced yesterday that it will shut down the Big C Mien Dong in HCMC's District 10 in the next 20 days, as it has failed to reach an agreement on the site lease with the landlord.
Given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Thai retailer has made efforts to reach an agreement over the extension of the contract with the site lessor to maintain normal operations at the supermarket and support local consumers during the post-Covid-19 period, according to a Central Retail representative.
However, new suggestions from the lessor over the contract extension have left the retailer unable to fulfill its commitment to offer products at low prices to consumers, following which it decided to cease operating the supermarket.
After the shutdown, employees of Big C Mien Dong will continue to work at other Big C stores, the representative added.
Aside from Big C Mien Dong, other Big C supermarkets under the Central Retail Vietnam in HCMC include Big C Truong Chinh, Big C Au Co, Big C Phu Thanh, Big C An Phu and GO! Market.
The Thai retailer said that it will adopt measures to minimize the inconveniences caused to the loyal customers of Big C Mien Dong by continuously offering them shopping and direct-to-site delivery services via the hotline 1900 1880 or through online shopping apps such as Chopp and GrabMart.
Big C Mien Dong, which is located on To Hien Thanh Street, is among the first Big C supermarkets that French retailer Casino launched in the local market in 2003.
Big C was then rebranded as Cora following an M&A deal between two French retailers.
From 2016 onward, the Big C Vietnam supermarket chain was officially owned by Thailand's Central Group.

British Covid-19 patient smiles after two months in coma.
A British man who is Vietnam's most critical Covid-19 patient so far smiled as doctors talked to him on Tuesday.
The Covid-19 treatment sub-committee under the Health Ministry said his smile carries a lot of meaning, showing that he has been more conscious.
The digestive system of the patient, a 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot designated as patient 91, has also improved as his abdominal distension has reduced.
His kidney functions have recovered and he has been able to move his hands and legs.
The patient has developed a stronger cough reflex.
His pulmonary ventilation has become more stable.
However, he still has to rely on the life support extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system.
The blood flowing through his ECMO currently stays at 3.7 liters per minute, and doctors are working to gradually reduce the system's oxygen flow to 1.5 liters per minute.
Previously, while he was still in a severely critical condition, the oxygen flow could go up to 5.7 liters per minute.
On Monday, doctors at the Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City where the patient is treated have started letting him have physical therapy twice a day.
Tran Thanh Linh, deputy head of the emergency department at the hospital, said an X-ray image of his lungs on May 25 revealed tissue or fluid blocking blood vessels in both lungs but the one taken on Tuesday showed that more than half of the left lung has recovered from such situation.
His muscle weakness has also been improved.
This is the right time to reduce his dependence on the ECMO, he said.
Earlier, the patient had suffered from the cytokine storm syndrome, which happened when his immune system overreacted to the novel coronavirus attacking the body, releasing too many cytokines, damaging his organs.
For now, he is still infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia, a type of opportunistic bacteria, and doctors said it is difficult to treat.
Vietnam has recorded 328 Covid-19 cases so far.
Vietnam passport ranks low in global ranking.
Vietnam is one of the least powerful passports in the world, ranking 157th among 199, says a report released Tuesday by Nomad Capitalist.
The global offshore consulting firm ranked 199 economies in terms of passport strength based on five categories. visa-free travel, international taxation laws, global perception, dual citizenship and personal freedom.
Vietnam's low ranking in the Nomad Passport Index 2020 reflects the fact that Vietnamese passport holders can only travel visa-free to 54 countries and territories, slightly more than Laos in Southeast Asia with 50, the Hong Kong-based firm said.
Vietnam also scored poorly in terms of global perception and level of personal freedom of citizens, travelers and expats, the report said.
In Southeast Asia, Singapore has the most powerful passport with visa free access to 190 destinations and a high level of personal freedom, followed by Malaysia with 178 countries.
Nine of the ten top passports were from Europe, with Singapore being the only non-European country to break into the top ten.
The Swedish passport was the most powerful with visa-free access to 186 countries and territories, high levels of personal freedom and an excellent global reputation.
The worst passport was from Afghanistan, with visa free access to just 26 destinations.
With the Donald Trump administration pursuing a hostile immigration policy, the U.S lost its throne as the most powerful passport in the world, slipping down to 40th rank.
According to Mastercard, Vietnam has the second fastest growing outbound market in the Asia Pacific region after Myanmar, with projected annual growth of 9.5 percent between 2016 and 2021.
The firm forecast some 7.5 million Vietnamese travelers would venture outside the country in 2021.

Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Ngoc Dong stated that the Chinese contractor's demand of US$50 million for the trial operation of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi City would not be considered by the Ministry of Transport as it goes against the provisions of the contract.
Stressing that the demand was not made in an official document, the deputy minister told the local media on June 2 that the Chinese side demanded US$50 million for the trial operation of the railway during certain online meetings held between them and the Railway Project Management Unit.
The payments for the railway project have been made by the Vietnamese side in accordance with the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract, the deputy minister noted.
In case the Chinese contractor sends a document requesting the capital, the demand will not be considered as it goes against the contract, Dong added.
Under the contract, even if the Chinese contractor suffers from financial difficulties during this time, they will have to run a trial operation, Dong remarked, adding that the Vietnamese side will not bear responsibility for any additional payment.
Vietnam has paid 70% of the amount due for the Cat Linh-Ha Dong railway project, while the rest will be paid before the project is handed over, in line with the provisions of the contract.

Vietnamese fabric exports excluded from Indonesia's new tariffs.
Indonesia's Ministry of Finance has imposed new tariffs on imports, effective from May to November 2022, to protect its local manufacturers due to the rising imports of fabric, fibers, and curtains, but Vietnamese fabric being imported into Indonesia is not subject to the new taxes.
Under the Indonesian ministry's Decree 56 year 2020, the levels of self-defense taxes are at 1,405 rupiah or US$0.93 per kilogram from May 27 to November 8, at 1,193 rupiah per kilogram from November 9 to November 8, 2021 and at 979 rupiah per kilogram from November 9, 2021, to November 8, 2022, according to VietnamPlus news site.
Several countries and territories, including Hong Kong and South Korea, are exempted from the new tariffs on synthetic fibers and curtains, while the fabric exports from India and Vietnam to Indonesia are not affected by the new taxes.
Last year, the Indonesian Government imposed temporary duties of up to 67.7% on textile and garment imports to protect its locally manufactured products and encourage domestic consumption.
Moody's has warned that the U.S.-Sino trade tensions will possibly prompt a shift in fabric, fibers and apparel products from China to Southeast Asia including Indonesia, hindering the stability of demand and supply and hurting local producers.
The United States has levied a 25% import tax on China's textiles and garments, higher than the levels of 10-15% being applied by Indonesia.

Chinese contractor demands US$50m for system operation of Cat Linh-Ha Dong project.
While the completion date of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi is not yet known and the inspection dossiers have not been completed, Chinese contractor China Railway 6 Bureau Group has requested US$50 million for the system operation before handing over the project.

However, on April 24, the Government agreed to allow entry to experts working on the project.
The Railway Project Management Unit has asked the Chinese contractor to complete the as-built documents and inspection dossiers for components such as the technical equipment, design of stations and depot.
Regarding the system safety certification, the unit will work with ACT Consulting and the Chinese contractor to complete it in line with the laws in Vietnam.
According to the Government, the completion date for the project has not yet been decided and the responsibilities of organizations and individuals for the slow progress have not been made clear. so, capital has not been allocated for the construction supervision package.
To address these obstacles, the Railway Project Management Unit suggested that the Ministry of Transport report the problems to the Government for solutions, extend the construction supervision package, and organize meetings with the Chinese contractor to discuss capital demand for the trial operation of the railway.

Details of the laws remain unclear, even to Hong Kong officials, but are expected to be enacted by China's parliament this summer.

Dinh Van Dong, 52, was charged with human trafficking and trafficking of a person under 16, the Hanoi People's Court heard.
In 2005, Dong lent Nguyen Thi Thu Ha, 36, a certain amount of money to help her mother pay off a debt.
In return, Ha had to coerce two women from Hanoi to sell commodities in China on Dong's behalf, local media reported.
Visiting Hanoi in May 2005, Ha met a woman named Hang who helped her persuade two anonymous sisters, one aged under 16, to travel to China.
However, both sisters were subsequently sold into prostitution, earning Dong VND3 million ($128), and Ha and Hang VND14 million ($599).
Police opened an investigation after the sisters' parents reported that they went missing.
They soon arrested Ha, who in February 2006 was sentenced to 17 years in jail on the charges of human trafficking and trafficking of a person under 16.
Dong was arrested in September last year.
Hang's whereabouts remain unknown.
The sisters have not been rescued.
Vietnam is a human trafficking and illegal migration hotspot with annual profits worth tens of billions of dollars, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
The country has recorded over 3,400 victims of human trafficking since 2013, over 90 percent of them women, children and people from ethnic minority communities, Nguyen Xuan Lap, head of the ministry's Department of Social Issues Prevention, said at a conference in November last year.
VinFast test runs electric car for launch at US show.
Automaker VinFast has tested its first electric car model in Hanoi with plans to introduce it in a U.S auto show later this year.
VinFast plans to launch the car at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November before promoting it in different countries in January next year.
It plans to start mass production in July next year.
The car is designed by Italy's Pininfarina, which also designed VinFast's first SUV and sedan.
The car is set to have a 470 horsepower engine and be able to run 500 kilometers on full charge.
VinFast is developing its own batteries for the vehicle using cells from South Korea's LG company.
VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest company Vingroup, started delivering its first cars in June last year.
The company does not release sales figures, but official data shows that 5,124 VinFast cars were registered in the first quarter.
This puts it in the fifth place in sales, behind Hyundai, Toyota, Kia and Honda.
Coronavirus deaths in US top 100,000.
Health officials say the actual death toll is likely far higher than the recorded count.
The US has passed 100,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak in less than four months.
It has seen more fatalities than any other country, while its 1.69 million confirmed infections account for about 30% of the worldwide total.
The first US infection was reported in Washington state on 21 January.
Globally there have been 5.6 million people recorded as infected and 354,983 deaths since the virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
The US death toll stands at 100,276, according to Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, which has been tracking the pandemic.
It means that around as many Americans have died from Covid-19 than from the Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
But on a per capita basis the US ranks ninth in its mortality rate behind the likes of Belgium, the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, according to the university.
British Covid-19 patient moves out of two-month coma.
Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient regained consciousness Wednesday after doctors reduced his sedation doses.
Patient 91, a 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot in Ho Chi Minh City, has started having cough responses, could move the tips of his fingers, make basic communication and follow doctors' simple instructions, said Doctor Nguyen Tri Thuc, director of Cho Ray Hospital.
Thuc said this development happened two days after doctors stopped using muscle relaxants on him and gradually reduced his sedation dosage.
His thoracic diaphragm and limbs, however, remained weak or paralyzed.
Doctors also stopped dialysis again after having restored the treatment for 24 hours.
The patient's condition is still severely critical, but his awareness, blood oxygen level and kidney functions have improved compared to two days earlier, the doctor said.
According to a treatment sub-committee set up by the Health Ministry, X-ray images of the patient's lungs Wednesday afternoon showed small improvement, and doctors have reduced the blood flow through the ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) system from 4.5 liters per minute last Friday to 4 liters per minute.
ECMO is a technique that pumps blood out of the body and to a heart-lung machine that removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back.
While the patient's lung functions have shown improvements, these are still not enough, Thuc said.
He would still have to undergo treatment for his lung infection with the goal of gradually reducing his reliance on the ECMO system.
The patient is scheduled to have a third chest CT scan Thursday afternoon for an evaluation of his lung recovery.
The health ministry sub-committee, Cho Ray Hospital's doctors and experts from major hospitals across the country would hold an online consultation Friday to agree on the next treatment plan for the patient, a pilot employed by Vietnam Airlines at the time he was confirmed infected.
Earlier, the patient had suffered from the cytokine storm syndrome, which happened when his immune system overreacted to the novel coronavirus attacking the body, releasing too many cytokines, damaging his organs.
The Vietnam Airlines pilot was the first case in the cluster of infections in HCMC associated with the Buddha Bar & Grill, a major outbreak site in the southern metropolis.
A few days after he was diagnosed, 18 others were also found infected.
Chemical castration proposed against child sexual abusers.
A National Assembly (NA) deputy has recommended that chemical castration be one of the penalties for those found guilty of committing sex crimes on children.
According to NA deputy Nguyen Ngoc Phuong from Quang Binh Province, chemical castration has been adopted in many countries.
Chemical castration involves using a drug to lower the testosterone level in men, which affects their sex drive.
If Vietnam approves the addition to the law on fighting child sexual violence, the number of child abuse cases could drop by 50% in the years to come, Phuong stated during a discussion on adopting policies and laws to prevent and fight against child abuse, held on May 27.
Aside from chemical castration, the NA deputy of the central locality suggested further penalties for child sexual offenders, including increasing administrative fines, disclosing the identities of sexual offenders and listing their offenses in their CVs, to deter offenders and prevent recidivism as well as protect children.
Phuong added that child abuse has caused a public uproar.
Many people he has met have called for offenders to be arrested and punished strictly and promptly.
Most child abusers are acquaintances or even parents of the victims.
They take advantage of the children's innocence to commit these crimes.
Some have even repeated their offenses and threatened to kill the victims if they dare to report them, Phuong remarked, adding that it is essential for the NA to closely monitor for the prevention of and fight against child abuse.
He proposed the Government should study plans to increase or impose extra penalties on child sexual predators.
Commenting on the increase in fines and penalties, NA deputy Duong Minh Tuan from Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province noted that Vietnam's legal framework was not strong enough to protect children from all forms of violence, resulting in a rise in child abuse cases and leaving a significant impact on victims, both physically and mentally.
Accordingly, Tuan suggested imposing heavier fines and sanctions on offenders.
Data released at the discussion showed that the country had uncovered over 8,440 child abuse cases between January 2015 and June 2019, with more than 8,700 child victims.
During the first half of last year, up to 1,400 children were reported as victims in child abuse cases, which is equivalent to some 80% of the total crimes against children recorded in 2018.py.
Minister said, no foreign individuals own land in Vietnam.
Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Tran Hong Ha stressed that no foreign nationals have been granted certificates denoting prime land use rights in the country, adding that the ministry will soon introduce regulations curbing the practice of aliens using Vietnamese as fronts to acquire land lots in the country.
Ha told reporters on the sidelines of the National Assembly session on May 27 that in line with prevailing regulations, foreigners are not issued land use rights certificates.
The Land Law states that foreigners are not eligible to own land lots in Vietnam, so the granting of land use rights certificates to aliens is nonexistent.
However, the regulations allow the issuance of land use rights certificates to legal representatives of foreign firms and foreign-invested enterprises as firms are allowed to receive stake transfers and capital contributions in line with the Investment Law.
The ministry is completing a legal framework for land to clearly form groups of strategic land lots, especially those of significant importance to national defense, to launch special policies for the handover of land, land leases and the issuance of land use rights certificates,Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, citing Ha.
HCMC to open Can Gio-Vung Tau ferry service in September.
The ferry route linking HCMC's outlying district of Can Gio and neighboring Vung Tau City is expected to be launched on September 2.
Bui Hoa An, deputy director of the HCMC Department of Transport, noted that the 15-kilometer ferry route will be put into service in early September instead of early April due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Quoc Chanh Ltd will operate the ferry route, with a single trip expected to take 30 minutes.
Currently, travel between Can Gio and Vung Tau is only possible by road and takes over three hours and 30 minutes, Thanh Nien newspaper reported.
Ferries on the route can accommodate over 250 passengers, 100 motorcycles, and 15 cars or trucks, with 24 trips expected per day.
The ferry route will also benefit local people in Long An and Tien Giang provinces as it will take them only two hours and 30 minutes to travel to Vung Tau using the new waterway route compared with using the HCMC-Long Thanh-Dau Giay Expressway.
Aside from saving on travel time, ferry passengers can enjoy the scenery along Rung Sac Road and visit tourist sites in Can Gio.
An noted that Quoc Chanh has proposed a ferry ticket price of VND50,000 per trip.
However, the pricing must be reported to the municipal Department of Finance for consideration and then reported to the HCMC People's Council.
The ferry terminals are under construction, and work on some transporter bridges is complete, remarked the deputy director of the municipal department.
The Can Gio-Vung Tau ferry route, coupled with the existing routes for Binh Khanh and Can Gio-Can Giuoc, will create more favorable conditions for Can Gio to connect with its neighboring provinces, reduce traffic overload and contribute to HCMC's socioeconomic and tourism growth, he added.
Vietnam suspends officials implicated in Japanese firm's bribery allegations.
Several tax and customs officials in Bac Ninh Province will be suspended for 15 days pending investigations into bribery allegations made in Japan.
The decision was made at the request of Finance Minister Dinh Tien Dung to the General Department of Taxation and the General Customs Department Tuesday, following reports that a Japanese plastic company paid the officials $215,000 in bribes.
Members of the tax and customs teams that inspected imports by Tenma Vietnam, which has operated in the northern province since 2007, and senior officials responsible for setting up the two teams are subject to the suspension order.
Among the suspension list are the head of Bac Ninh's Customs Department and deputy head of the province's Tax Department.
On Monday, the finance ministry began probing recent reports in some Japanese newspapers, including Asahi, that Tenma had bribed Vietnamese officials on two occasions - in 2017 and last year.
An Asahi report said that Tenma representatives on April 1 confessed to prosecutors in Tokyo that its subsidiary Tenma Vietnam in June 2017 had imported a batch of molds and Vietnamese officials demanded a value-added tax of JPY1.8 billion ($16.7 million).
To avoid this obligation, the CEO of Tenma Vietnam, which is based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, paid a senior customs official VND2 billion (JPY10 million or about $86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August last year, Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma Vietnam to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, of JPY89 million ($826,400).
It said Tenma Vietnam paid VND3 billion (JPY15 million or around $129,000) in cash to tax officials to get the dues lowered to JPY2.6 million ($24,300).
On May 1, Tenma announced on its website that the CEO implicated in the bribery would announce his resignation at a shareholders' meeting in June.
The company is being investigated for bribing foreign officials and violating unfair competition laws in Japan.
To Lam, Vietnam's Minister of Public Security, said Tuesday that Vietnam was cooperating with Japan on the investigation.
The information of Tenma bribing Vietnamese officials came from Japan, so we need international coordination to investigate this case, Lam said on the sidelines of a parliament session in Hanoi.
Representatives from Bac Ninh's People Committee, the highest executive body in the province, said Tuesday that a preliminary review by local police has not showed any abnormal signs.
Tenma Vietnam continues to operate normally at the Que Vo Industrial Zone in Bac Ninh.
Company representatives told local media that all of its senior officials are either away from the province or still in Japan.

Costa Rica celebrates first same-sex weddings.
The first same-sex weddings have taken place in Costa Rica, the first Central American country to approve its marriage legislation.
A lesbian couple became the first to tie the knot in a ceremony that took place just after the new law came into effect at midnight.
The wedding was shown on national TV.
President Carlos Alvarado said the law change meant Costa Rica now recognised the rights lesbian and gay people had always deserved.
He tweeted (in Spanish) that empathy and love should from now on be the guiding principles which will allow us to move forward and build a country where there is room for everyone.
The first same-sex marriage ceremony was broadcast as the culmination of a three-hour programme celebrating marriage equality.
Marriage equality came about after the constitutional court declared in August 2018 that a ban on same-sex weddings was unconstitutional and discriminatory.
The court gave Costa Rica's parliament 18 months to change the law.
Enrique Sánchez, Costa Rica's first openly gay member of parliament, welcomed the change and praised those who had spent years lobbying for the same-sex marriage ban to be lifted.

Zika infection confirmed in Da Nang.
A man in Da Nang has been found infected with the Zika virus, which causes microcephaly in babies, the first case in Vietnam in three years.
The unidentified man, 25, lives in Lien Chieu District and is under treatment, Pham Hung, head of the General Department of Preventative Medicine's department for communicable disease control, said on Monday.
The Zika virus is primarily spread through mosquitoes and potentially transmitted sexually, from mother to child and through blood transfusion.
The disease it causes, Zika fever, produces mild symptoms like fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, or rash in humans.
But it is known to cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies born to mothers infected during pregnancy.
Microcephaly causes an abnormally small head, intellectual disability and poor motor and speech functions.
There is no vaccine yet against Zika.
Vietnam's first reported case of Zika virus infection was in 2016 in the south-central province of Khanh Hoa.
By early 2017 the country recorded 265 cases.
One baby was born with microcephaly linked to the Zika virus in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak in 2016.
Like other diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, Zika virus outbreaks occur mostly during the rainy season.
In Vietnam, most cases have been recorded in the south but also in the central region and the Central Highlands.
Hundreds of marijuana plants grown in the coffee plantations discovered.
Police in Krông Năng District in the Central Highlands Province of Đắk Lắk have discovered hundreds of marijuana plants grown in the coffee plantations of two households.
The owners claimed they had only been growing the plants to feed their chickens, believing their leaves had medicinal qualities to help poultry avoid diseases.
Bui Thi Loan, 48 years old and her brother Bùi Thái Phong, 37 years old, both residing in Trường Hà Hamlet, Ea Hồ Commune have reportedly grown and harvested marijuana for a long time.
Police counted 442 marijuana plants in Loan's garden and 139 in Phong's garden with the highest plant reaching 2.5m tall.
They were also nursing hundreds of young plants.
Their farms were located in quiet areas and marijuana was grown together with coffee, allegedly to hide the illegal cultivation.
In 2013, the police of H.Krong Pak District in the same province found 1,042 marijuana plants in a garden of a local woman.
The grower said that she used the plant to feed pigs, fish, chickens, and ducks and did not know marijuana was harmful.
Loan and Phong could face the fines from VNĐ2 million to VNĐ5 million (US$85-214) for growing the banned plants.
Vietnam investigates alleged $215,000 bribery by Japanese firm.
Vietnam is investigating reports that a Japanese plastic company bribed Vietnamese officials JPY25 million ($215,000) to escape tax duties and fines.
The Finance Ministry has formed an investigation team to verify recent reports by some Japanese newspapers including Asahi that plastic firm Tenma had bribed Vietnamese officials on two occasions in 2017 and last year.
Asahi said that Tenma representatives on April 1 confessed to prosecutors in Tokyo that its subsidiary Tenma Vietnam in June 2017 had imported a batch of molds and Vietnamese officials demanded a value-added tax of JPY1.8 billion ($16.7 million).
To avoid this obligation, the CEO of Tenma Vietnam, which is based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, had paid a senior customs official VND2 billion (JPY10 million or about $86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August last year, Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma Vietnam to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, worth JPY89 million ($826,400).
Tenma Vietnam paid VND3 billion (JPY15 million or around $129,000) in cash to tax officials to get the tax lowered to JPY2.6 million ($24,300), the report said.
On May 1, Tenma announced on its website that the CEO implicated in the bribery will announce his resignation at a shareholders' meeting in June.
The company is being investigated for bribing foreign officials and violating unfair competition laws in Japan.
Bac Ninh customs officials have denied the allegations.
Pham Chi Thanh, deputy head of Bac Ninh Customs Department, said that Tenma, as a firm involved in processing for export, is eligible for zero import and value-added tax duties under Vietnamese law.
This means its imported goods does not have to pay any tax, and allegations that customs officials have received bribes for reducing the company's tax dues are baseless, he said.
Ngo Xuan Tong, director of Bac Ninh Taxation Department, said that apart from the newspaper report, his department has not received any official document from Japanese authorities on the matter.
He said that the department had only fined the company VND500 million ($21,500) for its delay in paying income tax on a portion of revenue, which are not related to the above-mentioned import tax incentives.
Tenma Vietnam was established at the Que Vo Industrial Park in Bac Ninh Province in 2007.
It produces plastic parts for vehicles and household items.
Workers plunge to death as scaffolding cable snaps at dam construction site.
Three people died and three others were injured after a scaffolding cable snapped at a hydropower construction site in Kon Tum Province Monday.

Tree falls in Saigon school, kills boy.
One student died at a Saigon public school and 12 others were injured after a tree suddenly fell on them on Tuesday morning.
At around 6.15 a.m., a 10-meter flamboyant tree of more than 50 years old in the yard of Bach Dang Secondary School in District 3 toppled and fell on a group of 13 sixth grade students sitting under it, Nguyen Van Phuc, the school principal, said.
Tran Hong Vu, a father, witnessed what he described as chaotic when he brought his child to school this morning.
I just arrived at the gate when I heard the thundering sound of the falling tree.
Then many students were screaming.
The schoolyard was in chaos.
Teachers and parents quickly pulled the students out, and ambulances took them to Children's Hospital No 2.
At around 9 a.m one of the victims, who has not been identified by the school, succumbed to his injuries.
More than 20 police officers cordoned off the scene of the tragedy.
Anxious parents flocked to the school to find out if their children were alright, but could not reach the management.
Many parts of the city, especially Districts 1, 3, 5, and 10, had received heavy rainfall on Monday afternoon.

Japanese firm allegedly bribes Vietnamese customs officials.
The Japanese media has reported that a Japanese plastic firm has admitted to giving bribes to Vietnamese officials to avoid paying taxes, said Thanh Nien Online newspaper.
According to an article in Asahi newspaper on May 11, Tenma Vietnam voluntarily reported to prosecutors in Tokyo that its affiliate in Bac Ninh Province had given bribes totaling some 25 million Japanese yen, or VND5.4 billion, to local customs and tax officials to dodge tax payments.
Prosecutors in Tokyo determined that Tenma Vietnam had violated Japan's laws against unhealthy competition, which prohibit firms from giving bribes to foreign officials.
Tenma's parent firm, based in Tokyo, has established a committee to investigate the case.
According to an April report from the committee, Tenma Vietnam in June 2017 received a notice on value-added tax payments levied on imported goods worth some VND400 billion.
Executives of Tenma Vietnam suggested the parent company issue bribes to local customs officials to enjoy tax exemptions or reductions.
With the approval of Kento Fujino, chairman of the parent company, Tenma Vietnam gave VND2 billion to Vietnamese officials, Asahi noted.
Besides this, in June 2019, Tenma Vietnam was asked to pay an additional amount of VND17.8 billion in taxes, as local customs officials had found that some of its earnings were not subject to preferential tax policies.
Therefore, Tenma Vietnam paid some VND3 billion to the officials to reduce the tax amount from VND17.8 billion to some VND567.7 million, according to The Nikkei.
Tenma voluntarily submitted the investigation results to the Tokyo Court on April 1.
It has yet to comment on the case.
Established in 1949, Tenma specializes in plastic shelf manufacturing, with combined revenue reaching 84.7 billion yen at the end of March 2019.

China says virus pushing US ties to brink of Cold War.
China said Sunday that its relations with the United States were on the brink of a new Cold War, fuelled partly by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and pitched the global economy into a massive downturn.
More European nations meanwhile moved to ease their lockdowns, with virus trends improving and summer nearing.
They loosened restrictions that have kept restaurants, bars, and hotels shuttered, devastating tourism, and they moved toward reopening more schools.
Globally, more than 5,3 million people have been infected by the virus, which most scientists believe jumped from animals to humans – possibly late last year at a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, suggesting the virus may have leaked from a top-security Chinese laboratory.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a political virus but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.
While once hard-hit European nations relax lockdowns as they work to salvage battered economies, other countries such as Brazil are emerging as new centres of the pandemic.
Trump on Sunday suspended travel to the US by non-Americans leaving from Brazil.
There was no immediate comment from the Brazilian government, run by Trump ally President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been dismissive of the virus and of lockdown measures.
The US death toll rose Sunday night to 97,686, according to the Johns Hopkins University, with more than 1.64 million cases of infection.
The US is by far the country worst hit.
Taiwan promises 'necessary assistance' to Hong Kong's people.
Taiwan will provide the people of Hong Kong with necessary assistance, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen said, after a resurgence in protests in the Chinese ruled territory against newly proposed national security legislation from Beijing.
Taiwan has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, which has been convulsed since last year by protests.
Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Sunday to protest against Beijing's plan to impose national security laws on the city.
Writing on her Facebook page late on Sunday, Tsai said the proposed legislation was a serious threat to Hong Kong's freedoms and judicial independence.
Bullets and repression are not the way to deal with the aspirations of Hong Kong's people for freedom and democracy, she added.
In face of the changing situation, the international community has proactively stretched out a helping hand to Hong Kong's people, Tsai wrote.
Taiwan will even more proactively perfect and forge ahead with relevant support work, and provide Hong Kong's people with necessary assistance, she wrote.
Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who seek asylum on the island.
Its laws do promise, though, to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.
The Hong Kong protests have won widespread sympathy in Taiwan, and the support for the protesters by Tsai and her administration have worsened already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing.
China has accused supporters of Taiwan independence of colluding with the protesters.
China believes Tsai to be a separatist bent on declaring the island's formal independence.
Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

German pharma giant CEO to Vietnam fined for nine-dash line mistake.
The Malaysian CEO of Bayer Vietnam was fined VND30 million ($1,300) Thursday for forwarding staff a document containing China's infamous nine-dash line.
The punishment, imposed by Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Information and Communications, came days after Lynette Moey Yu Lin, a Malaysian of Chinese origin, admitted sharing the document on China's successful Covid-19 campaign with nine department heads late last month.
These managers were supposed to subsequently forward it to lower-ranking staff.

Court upholds prison sentence against former HCMC official in murky land handover.
Former director of the HCMC Department of Natural Resources and Environment Dao Anh Kiet had his 6.5-year prison sentence upheld, following his earlier conviction in the illegal handover of public land to notorious real estate tycoon Phan Van Anh Vu.
The HCMC High-level People's Court on Friday turned down all appeals filed by the 63-year-old Kiet and three other individuals, in connection with the illegal handover of the 5,000-square-meter property at No.15 Thi Sach Street in District 1 to one of Vu's firms, Bac Nam 79 Construction JSC, reported the local media.
The three others convicted in the scheme were Truong Van Ut, 50, former deputy head of the department's Land Management Division. Le Van Thanh, 57, former deputy chief of the HCMC People's Committee Office. and Nguyen Thanh Chuong, 45, former head of the office's Urban Division.
The panel of judges said the behaviors, and roles played by the four defendants, were the basis of the first-instance trial in December 2019, and they failed to provide any new extenuating circumstances at this appeal trial.
Given this, the jury rejected their appeals and upheld the initial sentences.
Therefore, Kiet will have to spend six-and-a-half years in prison, Ut – five years, Thanh – four years, and Chuong – three years, for irregularities in the management and use of State assets, leading to losses and wastefulness.
The 44-year-old Vu, who moonlighted as an operative for the General Department of Intelligence with the Ministry of Public Security in 2009 and left the organization in 2017, was found to have proposed that the then-leaders of the ministry sign various legal documents that were sent to the HCMC People's Committee in 2014.
The aim of the proposal was to enable his company, as a front for the ministry's General Department of Intelligence, to lease the No.15 Thi Sach Street property with a no-bid contract for the ministry's professional operations, according to the indictment.
Since the proposal was granted, his company has collaborated with other firms to execute a construction project for Vu's personal gain.
The indictment states that Nguyen Huu Tin, 62, who was the municipal deputy chairman in charge of construction and land management between 2011 and 2016, had approved the lease deal in June 2015, restricting the company from being able to transfer, sublease or mortgage the prime land or raise revenues through the sale or lease of its land-use rights.
However, Tin signed another decision later that year allowing the company to become an investor for a trading, service and apartment complex project.
He later instructed the company to work with the city's agencies to complete preparatory procedures for the project.
As a result, the local government approved the project in May 2016.
Kiet, Ut, Thanh and Chuong allegedly sought advice from Tin in handing over the land to the company.
The company was not required to pay compensation for assets and architectural objects on the land, nor rent for the land, which flouted prevailing regulations.
Their errors caused State losses of VND6.7 billion.
Also, Vu and his partners have built a 18-story building and later put it up for sale and lease, earning revenues of more than VND1 trillion.
In this case, Tin, the city's former leader, did not appeal his seven-year prison sentence.

A photo of AirPod Pro case with Assembled in Vietnam message.
The Nikkei Asian Review had previously reported that AirPods have been mass-produced in Vietnam since early March, quoting.
the Vietnamese officials even granted special permits for a key Apple AirPods assembler to help the company bring in engineers to the country for smooth production during lockdowns.
However, this factory did not assemble the high-end AirPods Pro.
On social media and online forums, the AirPods Pros made in Vietnam have received positive reviews.
A person with the account name MrGimper wrote in the MacRumors forum.
I am quite surprised that Apple is manufacturing AirPods Pro in Vietnam.
I am using the second-generation of AirPods assembled in Vietnam and am very pleased with the quality of the product.
I hope it will be the same for the AirPods Pro.
Cole Slaw said.
Apple is diversifying its supply chain and that's good for the world.
I hope other U.S companies will follow suit to reduce their dependence on China.
The 'Technology lovers' section on China's Weibo said.
This is the first time a new Apple device has been made outside of China.
Many other Apple manufacturing partners are also planning to move out of China.
Vietnam is an attractive destination because of cheap labor and good infrastructure.
This is not the first time Apple is diversifying its manufacturing base.
In 2017 it assembled some iPhone models in India.
In June last year the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple had asked its suppliers to look for ways to shift 15 percent to 30 percent of production from China to other parts of Southeast Asia amid the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
In the past few months Apple has listed many job vacancies in Vietnam on LinkedIn.
HCMC pushes ahead with Vietnam's Silicon Valley plan.
The prime minister's support for the 'Vietnam's Silicon Valley' initiative has prompted HCMC to push ahead with a plan to merge three districts into one administrative unit.
The plan, which will to combine Districts 2, 9 and Thu Duc into one administrative unit and make it an innovative urban area, has been submitted by the municipal Home Affairs Department to the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee.
The department has come up with the plan following a meeting between Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and the city on May 8.
The plan to make a city within a city, temporarily called the Eastern Town, won the PM's endorsement.
This area has been in the making since 2017.
It would encompass the hi-tech park in District 9, the university precinct in Thu Duc District and the new urban area and financial center on the Thu Thiem Peninsula in District 2.
The Eastern Town is also expected to contribute to the establishment of value added chains based on high technology, modern technical and social infrastructure of international standards, and effective financial support for businesses.
It was to play a key role in linking scientific and technical research with commercial production to lift residents' lifestyle to international standards.
Le Van Thanh of the HCMC Institute for Development Studies had said.
This will be Vietnam's Silicon Valley.
The innovative hub would cover more than 22,000 hectares (54,300 acres) with a population of over 1.1 million.
Once the plan is implemented, HCMC will have 22 instead of 24 districts.
At the May 8 meeting, PM Phuc, while endorsing the merger of districts, said its official name will be decided later.
He also assigned the Ministry of Justice to guide the city on the next steps to take.
Former deputy defence minister on trial for land fraud.
A Navy Court Martial on Monday opened the first instance hearing regarding the mismanagement of defence land in HCM City's District 1 in which former deputy defence minister Nguyễn Văn Hiến, other Navy officials and company leaders are accused.
According to the verdict of the Central Military Procuracy, when Hiến was deputy defence minister and commander of the Viet Nam People's Navy, he signed and approved the use of defence land on Tôn Đức Thắng Street, Bến Nghé Ward for economic purposes without verifying the information provided by his subordinates.
This broke Defence Ministry and Government regulations, as well as the 2013 Land Law.
Hiến is accused of failing to supervise financial contributions and ignoring orders from the Defence Ministry.
These included his duty to verify why authorisation was given to a Hải Thành Company director to sign venture contracts, which resulted in partners using land-use rights certificates to take out mortages, change the nature of the ownership and transfer the land to third parties.
As a result, the Navy lost the right to manage and use three plots of land for 49 years, causing losses of VNĐ939 billion to the State budget.
On Monday, Nguyễn Văn Hiến, 67 and retired, was charged with lack of responsibility, causing serious consequences in accordance with Clause 3, Article 360 of the 2015 Penal Code.
Those accused of fraud and appropriation of assets included Đinh Ngọc Hệ, deputy general director of the Thái Sơn Corporation under the Ministry of National Defence, and chairman and general director of the Thái Sơn Development and Investment JSC.
Phạm Văn Diệt, general director of the Đức Bình Group Joint Stock Company and managing director of the Yên Khánh Production, Trading Service Limited Company.
and Vu ThiHoan, director of the Yên Khánh Production, Trading Service Limited Company and director of the Yên Khánh Hải Thành Limited Company.
Bui Nhu Thiem, former head of the Economics Division at the Viet Nam People's Navy.
Bui Van Nga, former director of the Hài Thành Service and Sea Island Tourism One-Member Limited Liability Company at the Viet Nam People's Navy.
and Tran Trong Tuan, deputy director of the Hải Thành Service and Sea Island Tourism One-Member Limited Liability Company, are also being prosecuted for violating regulations on land management.
At its 12th plenum last week, the Party Central Committee considered and decided upon disciplinary measures against Hiến - expelling him from the Party.
Bui Nhu Thiem, Doan Manh Thao, Bui Van Nga and Tran Ngoc Tuan were accused of making false proposals that led to Hiến's lack of oversight and subsequent approval of the documents, which caused great losses.
Dinh Ngoc He, Pham Van Duyet and Vu Thi Hoan were accused of acting fraudulently by forging signatures to transfer land use rights from Hải Thành Company to Yên Khánh Hải Thành Company for use as collateral for bank loans.
At a trial on July 31, 2018, the Military Court of Military Zone 7 sentenced Đinh Ngọc Hệ to ten years in jail for abusing his position and power while performing duties, and another two years for using falsified documents from agencies and organisations.
According to the Central Military Procuracy, when signing venture contracts the accused ignored land prices set by the HCM City People's Committee and agreed on deals for far less money.
As a result, between September 4, 2006 to 2018, the State lost over VNĐ20 billion.
Hien, Thiem, Nga and Thap were convicted of being complicit to the loss.
However, on Monday the Central Military Procuracy overturned that ruling as there was not enough evidence to support the convictions.
The first instance hearing is expected to run until May 20.
Hoa Binh Court sentences 15 in high school exam cheating scandal.
The People's Court of Hòa Bình Province on Thursday sentenced 15 defendants involved in the 2017-18 national high school exam cheating scandal in which dozens of candidates had their exam scores raised so they could graduate high school and enroll in universities or colleges.
Thirteen out of 15 defendants were charged with abuse of power while performing their official duties to inflate the exam scores of students.
Nguyen Quang Vinh, 54, former head of the Testing and Quality Assurance Unit under Hoa Binh Province's Education and Training Department was given eight years in jail for abuse of power while performing official duties.
Khương Ngọc Chất, 39, former head of the Internal Political Security Division under the Hòa Bình Police, Diệp Thị Hồng Liên, former vice head of the Testing and Quality Assurance Unit and Nguyễn Khắc Tuấn, an official of the unit were sentenced to six, five and three years in jail, respectively, for the same charge.
Do Manh Tuan, 41, former vice-principal of Lac Thuy District Secondary and High School was given seven years in jail for receiving bribes and three years for abuse of power.
Ho Chuc, 45, a former teacher of Thanh Hà High School in Lac Thuy District was sentenced to 30 months in prison for giving bribes.
Other defendants who are former education officials and teachers in the province were given 15 to 30 months either in jail or suspended for abuse of power while performing their official duties.
According to the indictment, the defendants have taken advantage of their positions and made use of their relationships to collude and intervene to raise the marks of candidates in the national high school exam in 2017 and 2018.
The intervention raised marks for 65 candidates who sat for the national exam in 2018 and one candidate who sat for the national exam in 2017.
Of the candidates benefiting from the scheme, 45 were forced to quit school after their exams were re-marked objectively, ten others could continue their university courses as their remarked scores were eligible for university admission.
Six other candidates did not attend university courses even though their re-marked scores met universities' requirements, one candidate failed to get university admission while another candidate did not apply for any university or college.
Court rejects defendants' appeal in fake medicine case.
The People's Court in HCM City on Wednesday upheld the verdict handed down at the first-instance trial in a case involving the manufacturing and trading of counterfeit medicine.
At the first-instance trial that concluded in October, Nguyen Minh Hung, former general director of Viet Nam Pharma Joint Stock Company (VN Pharma), was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and Võ Mạnh Cường, former director of H&C International Maritime Trading Co., Ltd, to 20 years.
Both faced charges of manufacturing and trading counterfeit medicines for treatment or prevention of diseases under Article 157 of the Penal Code, according to the city's People's Procuracy.
The remaining 10 defendants were sentenced from three to 12 years in prison.
Hung did not appeal after the first-instance trial.
However, seven of the 12 defendants in the case, including Cường, filed an appeal against the verdict reached at the first-instance trial.
Cuong said he did not play a mastermind role as mentioned in the first-instance verdict and that he did not know the drugs were counterfeit.
But the city's People's Procuracy rejected biện minh này, saying Cường directly contacted people who made counterfeit drugs and asked for permission to import the batch of fake drugs.
According to the People's Procuracy, the wrongful acts of the defendants were dangerous to society and the sentence at the first-instance trial was lawful and appropriate.
VN Pharma was established in October 2011 with the capital of VNĐ25 billion (US$1.075 million), rising to VNĐ40 billion in 2014.
Hùng owns most of the shares.
Since its operation, the company has imported various kinds of drugs.
From 2013 to 2014, Hùng ordered Cường to buy imported medicine that was allegedly manufactured by Canada's Helix Pharmaceuticals Company and supply the drugs to Vietnamese hospitals.
The order included 9,300 boxes of 500mg capsules of H-Capita, a cancer treatment drug.
The consignment was worth around VNĐ5.3 billion.
Hung said he ordered his staff to fake documents related to the drugs and submit them to the Drug Administration of Viet Nam, which operates under the Ministry of Health.
Hung also faked receipts and payment procedures to acquire import licences from the ministry.
In April 2014, the Drug Administration of Viet Nam questioned the origin of the drugs and decided to inspect the company's shipments.
The Ministry of Health concluded that the H-Capita 500mg batch contained 97 percent of the active ingredient capecitabine, which is of unknown origin and poor quality, and must not be used as a medicine for humans.
The Procuracy said Hùng's actions caused damage of more than VNĐ6 billion (US$255,320) to VN Pharma.
The court on Wednesday also asked the Ministry of Health to examine whether import companies have inflated drug prices to give commissions to doctors to sell the drugs.
This has resulted in high prices for imported drugs in Viet Nam, seriously affecting the quality of life, especially for the poor.
AstraZeneca ready to supply potential vaccine in September.
Drugs giant AstraZeneca has announced it is ready to provide a potential new coronavirus vaccine from September.
The firm said it had concluded deals to deliver at least 400 million doses of the vaccine, which it is developing with Oxford University.
AstraZeneca said it was capable of producing one billion doses of the AZD1222 vaccine this year and next.
Initial trials are under way and AstraZeneca said it recognised that the vaccine might not work.
But the company said it was committed to advancing the clinical programme.
Scientists have warned that a coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might not confer full immunity, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a vaccine might never be found.
Despite these reservations, intensive research continues, with about 80 groups around the world working on possible vaccines.
AstraZeneca indicated that production would take place in more than one country.
It thanked the UK and US governments for substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine.
AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot described the coronavirus pandemic as a global tragedy and a challenge for all of humanity.
We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world, he said.
We are so proud to be collaborating with Oxford University to turn their ground-breaking work into a medicine that can be produced on a global scale.
Company director arrested following deadly wall collapse.
The director of the construction company responsible for building a wall which collapsed killing 10 people has been arrested.
Ha Duy Hai, Director of Ha Hai Nga Co Ltd, has been detained by police in the southern province of Đồng Nai.
The 56-year-old's company was contracted to carrying work at AV Healthcare Company at the Giang Điền Industrial Park.
But on May 14, part of the eight metre high, 109m long wall collapsed, leaving 10 people dead and injuring another 14.
Right after the accident, the Prime Minister sent a notice to the People's Committee of Đồng Nai Province, ordering a prompt investigation into the case and strict punishment of violations in line with legal regulations.
AV Healthcare Company has leased more than 21,000 sq.m of land at the Giang Điền Industrial Park to build a factory specialising in producing diapers, milk bottles and tampons.
It hired a company as the constructor of the project.
Five million 'made-in-Viet Nam' medical protective equipment transported to New York.
A Vietnamese company has shipped five million medical protective supplies to authorities in New York, US.
Huynh Quoc Dinh, director of Super Cargo Service said the protective suits, face masks and gloves had been transported to New York to support the hard-hit city in the fight against COVID-19.
The company has co-operated with four airlines - Ethiopia Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Eva Airlines and Philippines Airlines – to transport the equipment on eight big-sized planes.
The New York authorities reportedly received the last batch on May 20's afternoon (local time), he said.
In early May, CBS News reported that New York Mayor York Bill de Blasio had discussed buying medical protective equipment from Viet Nam.
He said the city had ordered a factory in Viet Nam to manufacture the equipment in large quantities for the to help the US city.
New York is one of the biggest coronavirus hot spots in the US with more than 364,000 positive cases and more than 28,700 deaths as of the morning May 21.
Health ministry considers repatriating British pilot after being treated for coronavirus.
The 43-year-old British pilot working for national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, identified as the country's Patient No.
91, has tested negative six times for the novel strain of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
A sample of the virus taken from the patient and cultivated in the HCM City Pasteur Institute shows that he has developed immunity and won't get reinfected by the virus.
Chợ Rẫy Hospital in HCM City has received the patient from the HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases, where he has been treated since he was confirmed to be positive for the virus in mid-March, to continue providing intensive care, treat his underlying conditions, and manage the infections.
The patient will receive frequent consultations from the leading medical experts of the country to determine the optimal time to carry out a lung transplant operation, as his lung functions have deteriorated and he remains on life support.
Assoc.Prof.Lương Ngọc Khuê, Director of the Medical Examination and Treatment Management Department under the health ministry, said via the UK embassy in Việt Nam, the health ministry has not been able to contact any of the patient's direct relatives.
They have received information about a relative of the patient in the UK, but there has not yet been any response regarding the patient's treatment and possible repatriation, given that organ transplant can only be conducted with the relative's consent as long as the patient remains unconscious.
Khuê said that a foreign doctor working in medical transport in Việt Nam has contacted him and volunteered to bring the patient back to the UK, but the matter is being considered by the health ministry's leadership.
The patient reportedly has no insurance, but the costs for a lung transplant is already covered by donations from a benefactor organisation.
In just a week, more than 59 people – the oldest 76 years old, and the youngest 21 years old – have come forward to register to donate their lungs for the patient following reports of doctors looking at the possibility of a lung transplant to save his life, Khuê said, adding that this showcases the spirit of solidarity and compassion of the Vietnamese people.
Another option on the table is to repatriate the patient since he is now treated of COVID-19, but there are many complicating issues that may render the plan infeasible.
The patient remains in a coma and still relies on ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) for survival, so we need to wait until the patient is awake and recovers, then we can make an appropriate plan, the health official remarked.
So far, the treatment for the British pilot has lasted two months and three days, with the patient needing to be placed on life support for 46 days.
The latest CT scan of the patient's lungs show they have improved by about 20-30 per cent, while the patient's pulse and blood pressure have stabilised.
LGBT-themed movie a Netflix Vietnam favorite.
Goodbye Mother, an LGBT-themed movie, is the sole local production in Netflix Vietnam's ranking of 10 most-watched dramas.
Data thus far has shown that Vietnamese overwhelmingly favor South Korean TV dramas over other content on Netflix Vietnam, accounting for six of the top 10 most-watched shows Friday.
Topping the list was Money Heist, a Spanish television crime drama series on a bank robbery.
It is not often that a Vietnamese film breaks into the list of most popular shows among Vietnamese audiences since Netflix, worldwide streamer of movies and TV shows, began releasing its daily list since late February.
Goodbye Mother, screened on Netflix since April 1 last year, depicts the drama of Van and his boyfriend Ian, who've just returned to Vietnam from the U.S.
The couple are initially unable to come out about their relationship because of the taboo involved, especially in rural Vietnam.
This leads to friction between them, and Van is forced to explain the nature of their relationship to his mother.
The movie is the directorial debut of Trinh Dinh Le Minh, who studied directing at the University of Texas in the U.S.
He had done a few short films before embarking on his first full-length feature film.
Netflix has been available in Vietnam since 2016 at VND180,000 ($7.8) a month for a basic subscription.
It now boasts a total 31 Vietnamese films covering romantic, comedy, action to horror and adventure genres.
The service, with around 167 million subscribers in over 190 countries and territories by Q4 2019, has been seeking to produce and acquire rights for more Asian content to increase its number of global subscribers.
Netflix launched its Vietnamese language website last October.
Golden Kite award recognises actress' efforts.
Actress Hồng Diễm won the Golden Kite for her performance in television series Hoa Hồng Trên Ngực Trái (Rose on Left Chest) last week.
It was her first award for her ten-year career in the film industry.
She said in an interview with the actress about the award and her career, I'm moved because it is the first award in my career.
It also surprised me a lot.
I did not think that the leading role in a television series would win me the award.
I'm happy.
I want to thank the judges, the crew, and the fans for recognizing my efforts.
Hồng Diễm was a model before she became an actress.
It's taken her a long time to gain success in film.
I think that winning an award is not just about talent because you also need some luck.
I was the luckiest among the nominees at the Gold Kite awards.
She said, this award encouraged her and also challenges her.
I have to work harder in different types of roles.
I have never been asked to perform the role of a strong character or a gangster.
I think directors want me in roles they know I can play, so I haven't had much choice.
Normally, I perform the role of a woman who accepts her fate, but sometimes this type of role bores me.
I like performing a role that is different and my part in Rose on Left Chest gave me that chance.
I like the role and can sympathize with the character.
I understand what she has to endure and why she finds it difficult to get a divorce.

The company primarily produces and trades gold bars and jewelry, but also has investments in real estate, finance, and services.
The company's profit-making was at its highest between 2011 and 2013 when SJC made around VND200-300 billion ($8.57-12.85 million) in post-tax profits each year.
This fell to less than VND100 billion ($4.28 million) after the SBV tightened regulations on gold trading, alongside a cooling of Vietnam's domestic gold market, the company statement said.
SJC is one of 27 state-owned enterprises awaiting equitization, following which the state's stake will be less than 50 percent.
The equitization is set to take place this year under a plan set out by the Prime Minister.
Trà Vinh farmers expand organic rice areas.
The Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Tra Vinh has encouraged farmers to expand environmentally friendly organic rice fields that have improved the quality of rice and soil fertility.
In Cầu Ngang, more than 100 farmers in Cầu Ngang's Mỹ Hòa, Kim Hòa, Vinh Kim and Hiep Hoa communes signed a contract in 2017 with a company to grow organic rice on a total area of 82ha.
The company provided farmers with techniques such as sowing, fertilising, disease management, and harvest methods.
The company also supplied materials, and it guaranteed outlets for the farmers.
In the first organic rice crop, the farmers earned a profit of VNĐ30 million (US$1,300) per hectare per crop, up VNĐ6 million ($260) compared to normal farming methods.
Organic rice fields use less fertiliser and do not use chemicals.
Farmers can also breed aquatic species in ditches in the rice fields to earn additional income, or rotate rice and aquatic species on the same fields.
Thạch Mara, who has planted organic rice in Hiep Hoa Commune since 2017, said rice grown under organic standards develops well and adapts to climate change.
In his first crop, his 0.4ha rice field had a yield of 6 tonnes per ha, up one tonne compared to traditional farming methods.
He expanded the organic rice area to 0.7ha this year.
Tran Hong Nghiep, an agricultural official in Hiep Hoa, said to encourage farmers to grow organic rice, the commune guarantees outlets for farmers and link them with others who produce organic rice.
The commune's organic rice co-operative group has called on farmers to join the group which can easily link up with companies and access government support policies.
The group now has 49 members who grow a total of 52ha of organic rice.
Its members who rotate organic rice cultivation and black tiger shrimp or giant river prawn breeding on their rice fields earn a profit of VNĐ50 - 60 million ($2,200 - 2,600) per ha for each shrimp crop.
Nguyen Ngoc Hai, deputy director of the province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that farmers, companies and the State have developed linkages under the organic model, which has improved the value and quality of the province's rice.
Besides the health benefits of organic food, organic farming improves soil fertility and protects aquatic resources.
Trà Vinh grows more than 200,000ha of rice each year, but has only a few hundred ha of rice planted under organic standards.
The coastal province plans to increase its organic rice area to 1,000ha by the end of this year and to 2,500ha by 2030.
Long An Province faces severe water shortage.
The drought-hit Mekong Delta province of Long An this year needs more fresh water, but can only supply about 50 per cent of demand from its 35 fresh water treatment plants and stations.
Nearly 736,000cu.m of water will be needed by 2030, according to the province's planning on water supply.
Currently, its plants can only supply 206,000cu.m of fresh water.
It lacks more than 215,000cu.m of fresh water to serve industrial and urban development and people's daily activities.
In urban areas, fresh water is supplied by small and medium-sized plants operated by Long An Water Supply Sewerage Joint Stock Company, Kiến Tường Water Supply Sewerage and Environment Joint Stock Company, and others.
In rural areas, small water supply stations provide water to fewer than 300 households.
Nearly 40 per cent of the province's residents use fresh water, which is lower than the average national rate.
Authorities are concerned that the problem could become severe if they do not have solutions.
The province's People's Committee has instructed relevant agencies to adjust water supply to increase the usage rate among residents.
The province also wants to reduce underground water exploitation gradually, and attract investment to build a network of fresh water supply stations.
It has asked ministries for funds to build five sluices to prevent saltwater intrusion in the provinces of Long An and Tiền Giang, near Vàm Cỏ Tây River which supplies the Rạch Chanh Water Plant.
The province plans to build a reservoir to store fresh water in Thạnh Hóa District to supply water to nearly 12,000 households and for agricultural and industrial production.
In Cần Đước District's Phước Tuy Commune, which faced water shortage in the dry season, residents now have access to fresh water after the commune's People's Committee allocated funds to upgrade water supply pipelines and presented water containers to people who live far from water wells.
People have also been encouraged to use water economically.
The committee has called on enterprises to invest in water wells.
The commune has nine wells that supply water to more than 2,000 households.
Long An is one of several Mekong Delta provinces severely affected by drought and saltwater intrusion every year.
More than 8,000 households in the province lack fresh water.
In a similar situation, trees in mangrove forests in Mekong Delta Sóc Trăng Province's Vĩnh Châu Town have died or are dying because of water shortage, according to the town's Forest Protection Bureau.
Trees have died in a 1.5ha mangrove forest managed by the town's People's Committee and in a 175ha mangrove forest managed by the bureau.
The mangrove forests are mostly white mangrove and spotted mangrove more than 10 years old.
The upgrading and construction of a sea dike and a dam outside the mangrove forests to prevent saltwater intrusion has contributed to water shortage, according to the bureau.
Vietnam prepares second phase testing of Covid-19 vaccine.
A potential Covid-19 vaccine produced in Vietnam will be tested on 30 mice in order to determine its most effective dose.
The second phase of testing will be carried out early June, said Dr. Do Tuan Dat, head of the Hanoi-based VABIOTECH company, which produces vaccines.
During the first testing phase, 50 mice in the lab remained healthy two weeks after they were injected with the vaccine on April 26.
On May 14, researchers sent the mice's blood samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology for first evaluation.
The vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists of VABIOTECH and the U.K.'s Bristol University.
Dat said that since the end of January when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in Vietnam, VABIOTECH researchers have been working with scientists at the Bristol University to produce a vaccine for the disease.
If the tests prove successful on mice, the research team will seek funding from international agencies to take their work further.
The company estimates it will take at least 12-18 months to develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can work safely on humans.
A vaccine is generally considered the most effective way to fight a viral disease.
There is currently no approved vaccine or medication for the Covid-19, which has infected more than five million people with reported deaths rising above 329,000.
Around 150 Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being carried out worldwide.
Eight vaccines have begun human testing.
On Monday, Moderna, the Massachusetts biotechnology company, announced promising early results from its first human safety tests on eight volunteers.
With no new case confirmed, Wednesday marked day 34 without a new coronavirus infection caused by community transmission in Vietnam.
The nation's Covid-19 tally now stands at 324.
Doctors to transfer British pilot to Chợ Rẫy Hospital before lung transplant.
The country's 91st COVID-19 patient, a British pilot, will be transferred to the intensive care centre in HCM City's Chợ Rẫy Hospital to have a lung transplant when the patient is healthy enough for the procedure.
The hospital has improved its intensive care centre to ensure the highest safety before receiving the patient for further treatment.
This was the conclusion made at a telemedicine conference of leading doctors in the country on Tuesday to find optimal ways to save the patient.
Lương Ngọc Khuê, head of the Health Ministry's Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, said the Association of Young Vietnamese Entrepreneurs and many donors were willing to cover all medical expenses of treatment and lung transplant for the patient.
Also at the meeting, the doctors said the second computed tomography (CT) scan of the critically-ill British pilot – the 91st patient – showed positive improvements.
About 20 to 30 percent of his lungs have recovered.
The patient still has to depend completely on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).
Without the support, he will die.
If his lungs do not recover, the only way to save him is a lung transplant, Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh Châu, director of HCM City's Hospital for Tropical Diseases said.
The patient has been on ECMO for 44 days.
The patient has undergone two CT scans, one on Monday and another on May 13.
The first CT scan images on May 13 showed severe solidification and fibrosis of the lungs, making it difficult for oxygen to get into the patient's blood.
Only 10 percent of his lungs were working.
The 43-year-old male patient remains the most difficult COVID-19 case in Viet Nam, with a complicated disease progression since he was hospitalised on March 18 at HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
Viet Nam calls for special attention to COVID-19 response in Syria.
Viet Nam has called for special attention to responding to the COVID-19 epidemic which is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Syria, at a regular monthly meeting of the UN Security Council.
Addressing the May 19 video meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria, Deputy Permanent Representative of Viet Nam to the UN - Ambassador Phạm Hải Anh said humanitarian access must be maintained in all areas in Syria, and a favourable security environment be ensured for humanitarian activities.
He appealed to the international community to support Syria in this difficult time, including ensuring the supply of food and medical supplies necessary for COVID-19 prevention and control.
In his report, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock said the economic and humanitarian crisis in Syria is facing a great challenge by the risk of COVID-19 outbreak.
Though the country has so far reported only 64 cases, the local disease prevention capacity is poor.
Besides the impact of social distancing measures, the Syrian people are also facing rising inflation, with the prices of essential goods having doubled from one year ago.
Lowcock called on the international community to increase support to Syria in all possible forms.
The humanitarian crisis in Syria is the consequence of prolonged instability and conflicts during the past decade.
It is estimated that more than 11 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance.
Uniqlo to open fourth store in Vietnam.
Japanese global apparel retailer Uniqlo has announced that it will open its newest store in Vietnam on June 5.
Located on the first floor of Vincom Center Landmark 81 in HCMC's Binh Thanh District, the store covers a total retail space of some 2,000 square meters, which is equivalent to that of its recently launched facility in the city's District 7.

Of these, three stores have been opened in HCMC and one store is in the capital city of Hanoi.
Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu to build high-tech agricultural zone.
The southern coastal province of Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu plans to set up a 1,073ha high-tech agricultural zone in the next five years.
It will come up in Châu Đức District.
It will improve productivity and quality of agricultural products, enhancing their competitiveness and enable the creation of new-style rural areas besides creating jobs and improving incomes for local people.
The project is estimated to cost around VNĐ1.32 trillion (US$56.4 million), with the money coming entirely from private investors.
Public funds would be used for building infrastructure outside the zone such as roads, water and power supply systems and drainage.
The zone will have three separate areas for farming, processing and related services.
By 2025 it is expected to generate annual revenues of VNĐ712 million ($30,500) per hectare and profits of VNĐ411 million ($17,600).
The province seeks to mechanise and modernise its agriculture by establishing high-tech agricultural firms, piloting efficient models of hi-tech use in farming and processing and building value chains from production and processing to consumption.
The proposed zone will have 114ha under flowers and vegetables, nearly 15ha under mushrooms, 622ha under fruits, and 153ha under perennial cash crops such as pepper and cacao.
A 2.75ha area will be earmarked for processing facilities and services.
Lê Tuấn Quốc, deputy chairman of the provincial People's Committee, has instructed the project's consultants to consider construction of reservoirs to store water from the Rây River to irrigate the zone.
The provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will work with the consultants unit to complete the feasibility report and submit it to the provincial authorities for approval.
Sixty one high-tech agricultural facilities are operating successfully in the province.

Nguyễn Thị Thủy, Long's teacher, got a one-year jail sentence on a charge of lacking responsibility causing serious consequences.
The indictment stated that negligence of the three defendants was to blame for the boy's death.
According to the indictment, Phiến drove the 16-seat school bus to pick up Quy at 6am on August 6.
The two then went to pick up 13 students for school, including Long – the victim.
The six-year-old boy was picked up at Trung Yên Plaza Building.
At 7.22am on the same day, the bus arrived at the Gateway International School in Cầu Giấy District.

At 4pm on the same day, the boy's family received news that their child had not been present in class.
Later, the family was informed the child had been found inside the school bus and he had died.
Ministry sounds alarm as Chinese own rights to prime land lots in Danang.
Chinese-invested firms own the rights to a large number of land lots that are of significant importance to the economy and national defense in the central city of Danang, according to the Ministry of National Defense.
As of the end of 2019, some 149 enterprises with Chinese involvement were active in 22 border cities and provinces in Vietnam.
In Danang, there were 135 coastal land lots held by Chinese-invested firms between 2011 and 2015.
These land lots are situated in prime locations, such as the city's coastal urban area.
near Nuoc Man Airport.
along the Hoang Sa and Vo Nguyen Giap streets in Khue My Ward, Ngu Hanh Son District.
and urban areas in Phuoc My and Tho Quang wards, Son Tra District.
As Vietnam does not permit foreigners to make land-use transfer transactions, many Chinese nationals have funded Vietnamese people to have them purchase land lots in Danang.
Between 2011 and 2015, Chinese and Taiwanese nationals provided money to eight Vietnamese people to buy 84 land lots covering some 20,000 square meters in total in the city.
Moreover, seven Chinese-invested firms own several coastal land lots and have leased land for 50 years.
Chinese people have also founded Chinese-Vietnamese joint ventures, with Chinese capital contributions initially below those of the Vietnamese.
However, the Chinese investors gradually increased their investment to take over the firms as well as their land.
According to the Ministry of National Defense, the prime minister has asked the relevant ministries, departments and the Danang authorities to handle individuals and organizations involved in these cases.
The ministry stated that the total capital of 149 Chinese-invested firms operating in Vietnam's border areas is nearly US$31 billion.
They are active in various fields including hospitality, catering services, entertainment, clothing, aquatic products, footwear, packaging, toys and electronic components.
All of them were founded before December 2018 and employ nearly 4,240 Chinese workers.
Most of them comply with Vietnamese laws, but some have infringed on the law, including employing Chinese workers without registration, producing drugs, polluting the environment and evading taxes.
The ministry suggested that the Government assign ministries, departments and local authorities to inspect all Chinese-invested firms and projects in border areas, tighten control over Chinese nationals' activities and amend the law to prevent Chinese nationals from taking advantage of loopholes.

Nearly 300 Vietnamese return home from Thailand.
Nearly 300 Vietnamese citizens been repatriated from Thailand May 18, because of the development of the coronavirus pandemic in the neighboring country.
The repatriation flight was operated with the cooperation of Vietnamese and Thai authorities and national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines.

Following the prime minister's directives, Vietnamese agencies at home and the representative bodies overseas will operate further repatriation flights based on the disease's development and the local quarantine capacity.
HCMC faces extreme risk of flooding by 2050.
Bloomberg on May 17 cited a report by the McKinsey Global Institute claiming that the chance of flood disasters in HCMC could increase by five to 10 times by 2050 given the rapid infrastructure expansion in the city driven by economic growth.
This would result in economic and infrastructural damage, leading to billions of dollars in losses.
The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.
While the city can cope with flood risks that could affect 23% of its landscape, further urbanization will raise the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels.
This could cause some US$8.4 billion worth of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact.
McKinsey noted that the city still has time to adapt to avoid these risks by putting better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas.
Investments and fundraising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.
Vietnam is forecast to become the 20th largest economy in the world by 2050, with an annual economic growth rate of 5.1% according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Vietnam posts second fastest growth of rich population.
Vietnam ranks second among the world's top wealth markets in terms of very high net worth individuals over the past decade.
The country's average annual growth rate of those with a net worth between $5-30 million, categorized as very high net worth (VHNW) population, reached 13.9 percent during the 2010-2019 period, says Wealth-X.
This growth rate is only lower than Bangladesh at 14.3 percent, according to a recent Wealth-X report.
It attributes Vietnam's wealth performance to robust economic growth supported by a young and expanding workforce and deepening integration in regional manufacturing supply chains.
Vietnam has a workforce of over 57 million, 70 percent of which belong to the Y (commonly called millennials, born between 1976 and 1995) and Z generations (born after 1995), according to official statistics.
Last year, the Vietnamese economy expanded at 7.02 percent, the second highest in the last decade after a record 7.08 percent in 2018.
The rapid urbanization and an ongoing shift from low-productivity agriculture towards manufacturing and services in Asian economies, including Vietnam, have contributed to the growth of wealthy individuals, the report says.
China ranked third among the top 10 fastest-growing wealth markets at 13.5 percent, followed by Kenya (13.1 percent) and the Philippines (11.9 percent).
The rest of the top 10 comprised Thailand (10.6 percent), New Zealand (8.7 percent), the U.S (8.2 percent), Pakistan (7.5 percent) and Ireland (7.1 percent).
Vietnam had 25,727 millionaires last year, up 12 percent from a year ago.
Of these, 458 had a net worth of above $30 million, up 7 percent from a year ago, according to a report released earlier this year by global property consultant Knight Frank.

A newborn weighing 6.1 kilograms.
A 40-year-old woman in southern Vietnam has given birth to a baby girl weighing 6.1 kilograms (13.45 pounds), twice the average.
The mother was admitted to the provincial Children's Hospital Friday to deliver her seventh child.
She was 40 weeks pregnant and weighed 110 kilos.
As the baby was big, doctors decided to do a C-section, although all her previous children had been vaginal deliveries, each born between 3.6 to 4.8 kilos.
The baby born Friday is the heaviest delivered to date at the Soc Trang hospital.
Normally, a baby born at full term weighs 2.5-4 kilos on average, said Nguyen Thi My Ha, director of the hospital.
Despite being born heavy, the baby girl's health indices were all normal, doctors said.
According to health experts, babies born abnormally heavy could face several problems including respiratory depression and hypoglycemia.
The heaviest baby delivered so far in Vietnam is a boy weighing 7.1 kilos in the northern province of Vinh Phuc in 2017.
The second heaviest one is a baby girl in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai, born in 2008 weighing almost seven kilos.
Two other babies delivered in Da Nang and Quang Nam Province in central Vietnam weighed 6.5 kilos at birth.
Seriously ill pilot shows signs of improvement.
The 43-year-old is considered Viet Nam's most seriously ill patient and works for national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines.
He has tested negative for Covid 19 five times and doctors are preparing him to be transferred to Chợ Rẫy Hospital in HCM City for a lung transplant.
The treatment sub-committee, which is under the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, said that so far 260 patients have recovered from the disease, making up 82 percent of the total number of people to contract the disease in Viet Nam.
A total of 58 patients are currently being treated for coronavirus at hospitals around the country.
Most of them are in stable condition.
In another development, a delegation from the Ministry of Health (MoH) chaired by associate professor Lương Ngọc Khuê, director of the Medical Services Administration, on Saturday worked with medical staff at the Thái Bình Province General Hospital where 25 COVID-19 patients are being treated.
Experts from the MoH asked the hospital to do all they can to help the patients, give them special supervision, and regularly contact the MoH to discuss their conditions.
The most important work is preventing the disease from spreading to medical workers and other patients.
Earlier on Saturday morning, the treatment sub-committee assigned a task force team from the Hà Nội-based Bạch Mai Hospital to give professional support to the Thái Bình Province Hospital.

State should encourage casino investment to attract foreign tourists.
association.
The Viet Nam Association of Foreign Investment Enterprises (VAFIE) has proposed the Government to encourage the development of casino businesses and gambling activities in hotels and resorts to attract more foreign tourists.
The association said at present, casino and gambling activities are present in 43 hotels and resorts.
The domestic gaming and casino market has strongly developed since a full legal framework was put in place.
However, the economic efficiency of the gaming industry and casino business has not been commensurate with their potential because those are sensitive fields and there is not yet a consensus view among State agencies in attracting foreign investment to this field.
Besides that, the domestic legal system for this field has not yet approached international practices, according to the association.
One more important thing is that the Ministry of Finance does not have enough human resources for managing gambling and casino businesses, so evaluation and issuance of business registration certificates for businesses in those fields have been implemented slowly.
Therefore, the association said Viet Nam should learn in developing the gambling activities as well as casino businesses from other countries, especially Australia and Singapore, to complete the State management of developing these fields.
Specifically, the State needs to amend and complete policies and laws relating to gambling activities and casino businesses according to international practices to ensure stability and transparency for this entertainment market.
That would encourage investment from Vietnamese and foreign organisations and individuals to this market as well as attract more international tourists.
For the State management measures, according to VAFIE, the nation could establish a national council on the management of gambling activities and casino business like Singapore or allow local authorities to manage those activities like Australia.
The association has recommended Viet Nam set up a national council on the management of gambling activities and casino businesses like Singapore to directly solve problems relating to those fields.
The council is a Governmental agency headed by a deputy prime minister.
It also includes representatives from ministries, sectors and associations relating to this field as well as legal, psychological and sociological experts.
This council will give proposals to the Government on policies and solutions of managing gambling activities and casino business, including appraisal and license of investment and business projects, as well as monitoring those projects and solving problems.
That would minimise negative impacts on society and the economy.
Four men jailed for wildlife trafficking.
A court in Ca Mau Province on Thursday sentenced four men belonging to a wildlife trafficking gang to two to 13 years in jail.
Tran Quy, director of Hai Dang Company, which registered as a tourism agency, the kingpin of the ring, got 13 years.
Nguyen Hai Nam was sentenced to 12 years and Le Viet Linh to 10 years while Ngo Vu Lam got two years.
In January 2018, border troops found Dang's company transporting 113 pangolins and more than 300 kg of pangolin scales by boat in Ca Mau, and it failed to furnish legal documents for them.
Local authorities began an investigation into the company's wildlife breeding activities, and found that the animals were raised for trafficking.
Quy helped transport wildlife from abroad into Vietnam by sea before selling them for local consumption.
Trafficking of pangolins is not uncommon in Vietnam, where they are legally protected and classified as endangered.
The animals are sought after in the country and neighboring nations for their meat and the alleged medicinal properties of their scales.
In 2019, Vietnam seized 63.7 tonnes of pangolin scales, the largest volume in the world, according to the Netherlands-based Wildlife Justice Commission.
It is illegal to hunt, kill, possess, capture, transport, or trade protected animals in Vietnam, and they carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison and fines up to VND15 billion ($645,000).

The 315th patient, a 39-year-old man, illegally traveled to Vietnam from Cambodia on May 2 and visited his aunt in Tay Ninh Province's Tan Chau District.
At his aunt's request, the man then showed up at a police station and was sent to a centralized center on May 3.
On May 5, he tested negative for the coronavirus, but his second test result came back positive on May 15.
The patient is being treated at Tay Ninh General Hospital, while 17 people, who had earlier come into close contact with the 315th case, are under quarantine in the province.
Another patient, confirmed as the 316th, flew back to Vietnam from the Philippines through Can Tho International Airport on May 14.
The 19-year-old man tested positive for the virus on May 15.
The resident of Danang City is receiving treatment at Sa Dec General Hospital in the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap.

Vietnam mounts all-out effort to save the most critically ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot.
Vietnam has mounted an all-out effort to save the life of its most critically ill novel coronavirus patient, a British pilot who works for Vietnam Airlines, the national carrier.
Through aggressive testing and a mass, centralised quarantine programme, the Southeast Asian country has kept its tally of coronavirus cases to just 288 and has reported no deaths.
The 43-year-old man, identified only as Patient 91, who caught the coronavirus at a bar in the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City in mid-March.
More than 4,000 people connected to the cluster were tested, with 18 of them found to be infected with the coronavirus.
While most have recovered, the British pilot is on life support and his condition has deteriorated significantly.
On Tuesday, the health ministry held a meeting with experts from top hospitals and decided that the only way to save the man's life was with a lung transplant.
His case has garnered national spotlight in Vietnam, where the government has won broad support for its campaign to contain the coronavirus.
On Thursday, state media said 10 people, including a 70-year-old military veteran, had volunteered themselves as lung donors, but had been turned down by state doctors.
We are touched by their good intentions, but current regulations don't allow us to transplant lungs donated by most living people, a representative of the Vietnam National Coordinating Centre for Human Organ Transplantation (VNHOT) told the Tuoi Tre newspaper.
The patient has just 10% of his lung capacity left and has been on life support for more than 30 days, Tuoi Tre said.
Deputy health minister Nguyen Truong Son told media last month that Vietnam had imported specialist medicine from overseas to treat blood clots in the patient, but to no avail.
Vietnam has spent more than 5 billion dong ($200,000) trying to save him, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.
In March, Chinese state media said it had successfully carried out a double lung transplant on a coronavirus patient, a procedure it hailed as a significant method of treating the disease's most stricken victims.
Vietnam is hoping to capitalise on its success fighting the coronavirus by positioning itself as a safe place to do business as international manufacturers look to diversify their supply chains away from China.
Vietnam's coronavirus cases rise to 312 cases.
Vietnam reported 24 new coronavirus cases today, May 15, all of whom are Vietnamese returning from Russia, taking the country's total number of confirmed cases to 312, according to the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control.
One of the patients is female and 23 others are male, aged between 24 and 48.
They returned to Quang Ninh Province on Vietnam Airlines flight VN0062 on May 13, together with 321 other passengers.
All of them and crew members were sent to quarantine centers in Thai Binh, Quang Ninh and Hai Duong provinces after their arrival.
The 23 new patients were taken to Thai Binh General Hospital for treatment while the remaining one case was hospitalized at Quang Ninh Hospital No 2, the local media reported.
Vung Tau Airport to be rebuilt into urban area.
After being relocated to Go Gang Island, the existing Vung Tau Airport in the city center will be developed into an urban area.
The standing board of the Party Committee of Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province has met with representatives of a consortium comprising Van Phu-Invest Investment JSC and VCI Investment JSC, and of consulting firms to discuss the development of Hai Dang new urban area and another residential area at the existing airport in Vung Tau City.
The provincial government stated that the consortium had earlier written to the province seeking approval to study and invest in Go Gang Airport in Long Son Commune.
Besides this, the two firms proposed developing the two residential areas.
As for the Vung Tau airport, which covers some 172 hectares of land, the consortium proposed building a new urban area comprising a 35-hectare compact city, a 46-hectare central park, a 24-hectare transit and trading service complex, a 20-hectare financial and technology center and a 25-hectare complex.
The standing board praised the idea, calling on the consortium to carefully assess the density of the population, the number of vehicles and the traffic flow at the projected area to work out a solution for traffic connections and the construction of parking lots.
Apart from this, the consortium should reconsider the feasibility of constructing a financial center, the standing board said, suggesting gathering branches of banks in the province at the center.
Many urban traffic experts threw their support behind the relocation of Vung Tau Airport to Go Gang Island, pointing out that moving the airport from the city center would contribute to the establishment of new urban areas in both parts of Vung Tau.
Three get death for drug trafficking.
The Ha Tinh People's Court sentenced 29-year-old Hoang Ngoc Tan to death after he was caught carrying six packs of heroin from Huong Son District in the province to Ho Chi Minh City.
The drug was found in his motorbike trunk on October 7 last year by border guards.
Tan told the court that in September, he had been asked by a stranger on a social network to buy heroin in Laos and transport it to HCMC.
Tan was promised VND70 million ($3,000) for the job.
The heroin was brought into Vietnam via the Laos border.
In Nghe An, local 45-year-old Hoang Nghia Van and 37-year-old Cho Mua from Bolikhamsai Province in Laos were also sentenced to death for trafficking drugs.
Mua Ba Va, 32, of the province's Ky Son District, was sentenced to life for the same crime.
In March 2019, Van had met a woman named Nguyen Thi Ly in HCMC.
Ly asked Van to buy drugs when he returned to Nghe An and promised to pay him VND17 million if he succeeded.
A month later, Van returned to Nghe An and stayed there until May 9.
Then he went to Bolikhamsai in Laos to marry a woman and he met Cho Mua, a relative of his wife.
Cho Mua agreed to purchase drugs for Van.
After the wedding, Van returned to Vietnam and informed Ly that he has found a source.
Ly said she would send Van VND2 billion to buy 15 kilos of ketamine.
On May 27, Van received the money from Ly and gave it to Cho Mua, who used it to purchase the ketamine from a Laotian.
Mua hired Va to transport the drugs for $2,000.
After receiving the drugs in the forest, Mua rode a motorbike carrying Va, who was holding the packages in the back.
The two were caught in Huong Son District, Ha Tinh Province.
Van was arrested as he waited for Mua to deliver the ketamine to him.
Police have not been able to find and verify the identity of Nguyen Thi Ly.
Vietnam is a key trafficking hub for drugs from the Golden Triangle, an intersection of Laos, Thailand and Myanmar and the world's second largest drug producing area after the Golden Crescent in South Asia.
Vietnam has some of the harshest punishments for drug trafficking, awarding death to those convicted of possessing or smuggling over 600 grams of heroin or more than 2.5 kg of methamphetamine and to those producing or selling 100 grams of heroin or 300 grams of other illegal narcotics.
However this does not seem to have had a deterrent effect, with increasing drug trafficking cases coming to light in recent years.
Su Ngoc Khuong, senior director of real estate service firm Savills Vietnam, said Vietnam's political stability and fast economic growth are positive factors for drawing foreign investment.
A recent report by real estate service firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) shows that Vietnam's industrial land prices rose by up to 12 percent year-on-year in the first quarter despite pandemic impacts.
Industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and therefore land prices are expected to increase in line with the long-term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, said Stephen Wyatt, country head of JLL Vietnam.
Most industrial land developers have posted strong numbers in the first quarter despite the pandemic.
VNDIRECT analysts said that Vietnam was ready to become an alternative manufacturing hub to China, adding that the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau and the northern provinces of Bac Giang and Hai Duong could become new industrial hotspots thanks to improved infrastructure.
Prolonged heatwave expected.
A heatwave affecting many parts of Vietnam is expected to continue, with temperatures reaching as high as 35-38 degrees Celsius.
The National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF) forecast that hot weather will hit northern Vietnam between May 15 and 16 with a maximum temperature of 36 degrees Celsius.
The heatwave is also expected to envelop the northern mountainous areas and the central region, where high temperatures could reach some 35-38 degrees Celsius, or even higher in some places.
The temperature is predicted to stay above 35 degrees Celsius from 11 a.m to 4 p.m.
The hot weather sweeping central localities will likely last until May 21, stated NCHMF.
In the Central Highlands and southern regions, high temperatures of 35-37 degrees Celcius are expected today, May 15.
The widespread heatwave may end in these regions around May 16.
Similarly, the capital city of Hanoi will endure the scorching heat until May 17.
The impact of hot temperatures coupled with low humidity and the southwest monsoon will pose a high risk of fire and explosions in residential areas due to a rising demand for power, as well as forest fires in the central provinces and northern mountainous region.
Besides this, hot weather can lead to many health problems such as dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures.
Israeli company uncovers cyberattack on Vietnam, neighbors by China-linked group​.
A ransomware attack targeting government systems in Vietnam and several neighboring countries has been discovered by an Israeli cybersecurity firm.
Check Point Research said in a report last Thursday the cyber espionage operation has been going on under the radar for years and is connected to Naikon Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, which cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky, ThreatConnect and Defense Group exposed in 2015 as having links to China.
The group's goal is to gather geo-political intelligence from government entities in Vietnam, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Brunei, and the Philippines.
Its specific targets are ministries of foreign affairs and science and technology besides government-owned companies.
For instance, the group disguised one of its attacks as an email sent from a government embassy in Asia Pacific to the Australian government.
Inside the malicious email was a file called The Indians Way.doc containing the backdoor Trojan, Aria-body.
Check Point said the Trojan can not only locate and collect specific documents from infected computers and networks in government departments, but also extract data from removable drives, take screenshots and log keys, and of course harvest the stolen data for espionage.
Vietnam cybersecurity company VSEC said Naikon still uses the popular attack method of sending a decoy email with a malicious file.
When the victim opens the email, the computer automatically installs the malware, helping hackers collect information, steal sensitive documents and attack other computers in the same system and elsewhere.
Naikon also turns victims' malware-infected devices and servers into a C2 server to launch new attacks targeting other government agencies.
Truong Duc Luong, a VSEC cybersecurity expert, said Naikon's return represents new threats to cybersecurity since it has likely silently studied and developed new, sophisticated and more dangerous attacks during the last five years.
In the past hacker group APT30 also used malicious software to access computers containing important political, economic and military intelligence in Asia, mainly Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and India.
The espionage campaign lasted 10 years before being discovered by security company FireEye in 2015.
The Department of Information Security said in the first four months of this year it recorded a total of 1,056 cyberattacks on Vietnam, a 51.4 percent year-on-year drop.
24 repatriates are Vietnam's latest Covid-19 patients.
Vietnam's Covid-19 tally jumped to 312 Friday morning after 24 citizens repatriated from Russia were confirmed positive.
Friday morning marked 29 days straight that Vietnam has gone without any cases caused by community transmission.
Russia is the third worst infected country, after the U.S and Spain, with more than 252,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,305 deaths.
But Vietnam health authorities have confirmed there is no likelihood of community transmission from the latest patients.
The 24, one woman and 23 men, aged between 24 and 47, had returned to Vietnam on Vietnam Airlines flight VN0062 from Russia to the northern province of Quang Ninh on Wednesday under a government program to repatriate Vietnamese residents living and working abroad.
They had been quarantined on arrival at centralized facilities in the provinces of Quang Ninh, Thai Binh and Hai Duong.
Twenty-three of the latest patients are now treated at the Thai Binh General Hospital and the other at Hospital No.2 in Quang Ninh Province.
With many special repatriation flights planned, the country will continue its focus on those arriving from abroad.
Everyone entering the country will be placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days, the period said to be the incubation time for the Covid-19 virus.
As of Friday, no Covid-19 death has been reported in the country.
The health sector is searching for a matching donor to provide a lung transplant for the most critical Covid-19 case in the country, a 43-year-old British man whose lungs are just 10 percent functional.
The pandemic has affected 213 countries and territories, killing more than 303,000 people.
PM permits re-opening of sub-border gates with China.
The Prime Minister has allowed the re-opening of sub-border gates and border crossings to resume trading activities between Việt Nam and China, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
The permission has been issued according to the proposals from the ministry and people's committees of Lạng Sơn and Quảng Ninh provinces on restoring those activities to get back to normal at border gates between the two countries.
They include Bình Nghi, Na Hình, Nà Nưa, Pò Nhùng and Bắc Phong Sinh sub-border gates and Ka Long border crossing.
Meanwhile, the PM has also allowed the people's committees of border provinces to actively resume operation of other sub-border gates and border check-points in those provinces based on the local situation and the Government's existing regulations on management of land border gates and border trade activities.
The localities only re-open the sub-border gates that have large volume of goods at those gates, especially agricultural and aquatic products for export and imported raw materials for domestic production which are permitted to trade via the border gates by the local authorities of the two sides.
The PM has also requested those provinces to ensure control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic for people and vehicles engaged in import and export activities under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and other relevant State offices.
Ten Vietnamese offer to donate lungs for British pilot.
As of this morning, May 14, as many as Vietnamese people have contacted the Vietnam National Coordinating Center for Human Organ Transplantation offering to donate lungs to the critically ill 91st coronavirus case, a 43-year-old British pilot.
The pilot was hospitalized on March 18 and remains the most critical Covid-19 case in Vietnam.
Experts said a lung transplant is the last chance to save him.
Lung ultrasound scans on May 13 showed that both his lungs have suffered extensive damage and only 10% of his lungs can function.
Luong Ngoc Khue, director of the Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, noted that the man is 1.83 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms, so it is hard to find suitable organs for a lung transplant.
The difference in size between the donated organ and the patient's organ should not exceed 20%, not to mention immunity and other biochemical factors, he explained.
Doctors plan to transfer him from the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases to Cho Ray Hospital.
Once an organ that meets size, immunity and biochemical requirements is found, doctors from Vietnam-Germany Hospital and other hospitals that have successfully performed lung transplants will perform the operation.
A representative of the Vietnam National Coordinating Center for Human Organ Transplantation noted that the donated organs, including whole lungs or parts of lungs, must come from a brain-dead person.
For a living donor, the person must be the pilot's relative.
According to the Ministry of Health, British authorities recently contacted the patient's aunt.
The pilot is single and it is unknown whether his parents are alive.
Meanwhile, national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines told the ministry that the man was not its official pilot but worked for the airline through an aviation human resource company.

Traffic police to make random inspections from May 15.
Traffic police nationwide will have the right to stop any driver to check their vehicle registration certificate, driving license, vehicle insurance, certificate of technical safety and environmental protection and other vehicle documents from May 15 to June 14.
The campaign was introduced by the Traffic Police Department to ensure safety and order as traffic in the country has worsened after social distancing measures and travel restrictions were removed.
Any motorbike, car, bus, coach, or container truck can be stopped for inspection, according to Thanh Nien newspaper.
Traffic police will also focus on handling traffic violations such as exceeding speed limits, driving in the wrong direction, not wearing a helmet, running red lights, recklessly overtaking and driving under the influence of alcohol.
The police will use handheld cameras or vehicle dash cams to record violations, which will be used as proof when determining penalties.
When performing breath alcohol tests, traffic police have to follow the instructions of the ministries of Public Security and Health to ensure safety and hygiene.
Breath alcohol testers must be carefully sanitized, and each breath pipe can only be used by one person.
Chinese man gets death for killing Vietnamese mother-in-law.
A Chinese man was sentenced to death Tuesday in the southern province of Tay Ninh for murdering his Vietnamese mother-in-law.
Xiong Zhoughen, 39, killed Vo Thi Mong Diep in a heated fight last year.
In 2018, Zhougen had married Diep's daughter and the couple had moved to China.
His wife later returned to Vietnam and began living with her mother in May last year.
The following month, Zhougen traveled to Vietnam and lived with his wife and mother-in-law for a few days before asking Diep for money to return home to China.
Diep said she had no money and asked Zhougen to leave.
A verbal fight then escalated into a physical one, between Diep and Zhongen.
Zhougen then hit Diep repeatedly in the head and face with a hammer before using a knife to slit her throat until she lay motionless.
Zhougen tried to escape after the murder, but was apprehended later.
Hà Nội provides medical supplies to help Moscow cope with COVID-19.
On behalf of the Party organisation, administration and people of Hà Nội, Chairman of the city People's Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung presented medical supplies to the Russian capital of Moscow and the Vietnamese community in the country on Tuesday, in support of efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the handover ceremony, Hà Nội presented 100,000 antibacterial cloth face masks and 50,000 medical face masks to Moscow, along with another 50,000 masks to the Vietnamese Embassy and Vietnamese community in Russia.
Chairman Chung said all countries are making every effort to contain the pandemic but none can single-handedly deal with the problem.
Based on the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership and the traditional friendship between the two capitals, the Party organisation, administration and people of Hà Nội wish to share some of their resources with Moscow's administration and people in the fight against COVID-19, he noted.
For his part, Russian Ambassador to Việt Nam Konstantin Vnukov said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Việt Nam and the country's Government, necessary measures have been adopted to curb the pandemic and Việt Nam is now among the best performers in combating COVID-19.
On behalf of the Moscow administration and people, he thanked Hà Nội for the gifts.
Court upholds 17-year prison sentence for former Danang leader in illicit land acquisition.
On Tuesday, the High-level People's Court of Hanoi City delivered its rulings on the appeals by the 64-year-old Minh.
his successor Van Huu Chien, 66.Phan Van Anh Vu, 44, who was the chairman of Bac Nam 79 Construction JSC.
and 17 other defendants.
The panel of judges dismissed the appeals of Minh and Vu, who were found guilty of breaking regulations on the management and use of State properties, leading to losses and wastefulness, and those on land management.
Having taken the case's evidence and their testimonies into account, the higher court said the first-instance verdicts against the duo were based on reasonable, lawful and just grounds.
Therefore, Minh and Vu will spend 17 and 30 years, respectively, behind bars for the two charges.
Meanwhile, Chien, who served as the Danang leader between 2011 and 2016, had his sentence commuted by two years to 10 years, due to his efforts to recover part of the damage.
They were found to have caused a total loss of some VND22 trillion (US$945 million) for the State through the transfer of 22 public housing and land complexes and seven real estate projects.
The higher court stated there were sufficient grounds to prove Minh was the key individual who developed the policy to transfer these public properties and had directed Chien and others accused in the case to commit the criminal act.
The first-instance verdicts, which concluded that Minh and Chien had played major roles in the case, were lawful, according to the judges.
At the appellate court, the former business mogul Vu appealed against the entire first-instance verdict, claiming that he had no close relationship with the city's leaders and thus ruled out the chance that he could have been their accomplice.
However, the higher court determined that Vu had a close relationship with the former leaders, so the charges against him were appropriate.
Vu moonlighted as an operative for the General Department of Intelligence with the Ministry of Public Security in 2009 and left the organization in 2017.
During that time, he abused his position and urged the ministry's then-leaders enabled him to buy and transfer many State-owned plots of land in prime locations.
Ex-chairman Minh was aware that Vu was not eligible to purchase these properties but still gave him the go-ahead to do so.
Minh and his subordinates were found guilty of having granted Vu a number of unlawful privileges, such as property handover at concessional prices without going through the due process of an auction.
For the remaining 17 defendants, their prison sentences were either reduced to between one and six years or became noncustodial sentences.
Many countries have banned plastic bags.
It is not able to deny the convenience of plastic bags, but the overuse of plastic bags and the lack of the waste disposal methods have damaged our environment.
Now, plastic bags are the enemy of human beings and the environment.
Since October, beside supermarkets, confectioneries are also prohibited to provide free plastic bags to customers in Korea.
In Australia, the supermarket chain Coles has started offering free eco-friendly bags for one month since the beginning of this month, with the purpose of helping customers adjust their shopping habits and preparing for stopping using plastic bags in the future.
Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court of Chile has approved has ratified a bill to ban the use of plastic bags in businesses, paving the way for it to become the first country in Latin America to adopt the environmental protection measure.
EU, France back Vietnam in fight against climate change.
The European Union and the French Development Agency (AFD) have established a 20-million-euro ($21.5 million) fund to help Vietnam deal with climate change.
The EU will provide the money as a non-refundable grant to the AFD to run the fund.
The latter will, in turn, provide loans for strategic projects in Vietnam to improve the management of water and other resources and respond to challenges like floods and coastal erosion that climate change exacerbates.
EU ambassador to Vietnam, Giorgio Aliberti, who signed an agreement for the fund with Fabrice Richy, director of AFD, in Vietnam on Monday, said.
Adaptation to climate change is crucial for the sustainability of Vietnam's development, and water and natural resources are a key element of it.
The intention of the new 20-million-euro grant is to support Vietnam on a pathway towards a greener and resilient future and enhance natural resources management that will help restore and preserve ecosystems and boost the resilience of the local population.
According to the World Bank, 70 percent of the country's population are vulnerable to typhoons, floods, droughts, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, landslides, forest fires, and occasional earthquakes.
The risks are exacerbated by climate change.
Floods and storms account for more than 40 percent of all-natural disasters.
Vietnam is one of six economies most affected by climate change between 1999 and 2018, according to the Global Climate Risk Index published last year by German environmental think tank Germanwatch.
Rising temperatures and sea levels, and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events combined with population growth and urbanization are increasing the risk of coastal erosion, urban flooding and drought.
This year saltwater intruded 50-110 kilometers into major rivers in the Mekong Delta, even deeper than in 2016, which was considered a very bad year.
Six delta provinces, Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Long An, Kien Giang, Ca Mau, and Soc Trang have declared an emergency over the salinity.
Senior Vietnam Expressway Corporation official arrested.
A deputy general director of state-run Vietnam Expressway Corporation was arrested Monday over violations in managing the Da Nang – Quang Ngai Expressway project.
Le Quang Hao was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security's investigative police department for construction law violations that led to serious consequences.
Hao is said to be responsible for not following procedures, standards and design requirements in overseeing inspection of a 65-kilometer section of the expressway, which resulted in poor project quality.
Fourteen other people including employees of the corporation, the country's biggest expressway builder, members of the project management board and staff of other companies have also been arrested in the case.
Reports about poor construction quality of the expressway, the first expressway in the country's central region that connects Da Nang City and Quang Ngai Province, first surfaced in 2018 after it developed cracks and potholes.
Construction of the expressway had begun in 2013.
A part of it was opened to traffic in 2017 and it became fully operational in September the following year.
However, just a month after the opening, cracks and potholes were seen in the aftermath of a heavy downpour in the area.
These were hundreds of square centimeters wide and 5-10 centimeters deep.
The expressway cost over VND 34.5 trillion ($1.4 billion) to build.
China's East Sea fishing ban invalid agriculture ministry.
Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Monday rejected China's ban on fishing in Vietnamese sea territory.
The ministry said the ban is invalid and directed provinces and cities to encourage fishermen to continue with their activities within Vietnam's territorial waters.
They should also guide groups and teams to support fishermen at sea, it said in a statement.
The East Sea is internationally known as the South China Sea.
The ministry said fishing vessels with licenses valid until the end of this year can fish in the Tonkin Gulf common fishing area, but asked them to avoid the area east of the Tonkin Gulf delimitation line.
The ministry has also requested local authorities to strengthen the management and supervision of fishing activities and monitor fishing vessels' departure actively during this period, adding that the hotline of the Department of Fisheries Control will be available for emergencies.
On April 30, the Hainan Provincial Department of Agriculture announced that China's annual fishing ban on the South China Sea has begun on May 1 and would last until August 16, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported, citing the South China Sea branch of the China Coast Guard.
The ban would apply to certain sea areas of the South China Sea that encompass parts of the Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam's Hoang Sa (Paracel) Islands.
No fishing activities are allowed in sea areas under China's sovereignty within the time period, except in certain cases, according to the Hainan department.
During the ban, China would perform safety checks for fishing equipment and vessels, as well as instruct its fisherpeople on relevant policies and skills, it said.
The Vietnam Fisheries Society has opposed China's unilateral decision, saying the fishing ban has no legal value oversea areas under Vietnam's sovereignty.
Four days later, Vietnam's Foreign Ministry also expressed clear opposition and asked Beijing not to complicate the situation further.
Vietnam has full legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) Islands, as well as its legal rights over its waters in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said.
China had seized the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam by force in 1974, and has been illegally occupying it since.
In 2012 it established the so-called Sansha City.
The city also covers a number of reefs in the Spratly Islands that China seized by force in 1988 as well as the Scarborough Shoal.
France to import hundreds of millions of masks from Việt Nam.
France has announced it would import hundreds of millions of antibacterial cloth masks from Việt Nam by air.
Accordingly, around 50 direct flights from Việt Nam to international airport Roissy-Charles de Gaulle in Paris will be operated until the end of May for the mask deliveries.
According to Tuổi trẻ (Youth) newspaper, Patrick Martin, president of the French Employers Association, said French businesses have been rushing to buy masks at high prices.
They must prepare the masks before citizens return to work under the newly announced easing of the country's lockdown.
It was estimated that France would need 250 million masks each month while the country could only produce 40 million.
They therefore have to import masks to meet demand.
RTL Radio said made-in-Việt Nam masks would be given to students, police officers and civil servants, as well as being sold at pharmacies.
The transport and logistics group Bolloré Logistics would take responsibility to bring the masks to France quickly.
The company is expected to organise two flights a day to transport the masks.
Commune Party secretary commits murder for insurance fraud.
Do Van Minh, 49, Party secretary of Lien Ha Commune in Lam Dong Province, has been accused of murdering his nephew-in-law and staging what looks like a fatal accident to illegally gain VND18 billion in insurance payouts.
Speaking at a press briefing today, May 11, the Dak Nong police noted that during their preliminary investigation after arresting the culprit the previous day, Minh had admitted to purchasing life insurance with an annual premium of over VND200 million in early April.
Upon his death, his family members would be paid VND18 billion by the insurance company.
Having incurred a debt of over VND10 billion, Minh decided to fake his death, so his wife and children could receive the insurance payout.
Minh owns two farms in Dak G'Long District in Dak Nong Province, which he visits on Fridays and Saturdays.
On May 3, Minh visited the farm of his nephew in law Tran Nho Vuong in Dak Nong Province, where he ate dinner.
At 5 a.m the next day, Minh killed the 25-year-old man with a hammer.
He then transported his nephew-in-law's body in a pickup truck on National Highway 28 in Dak G'Long District, crashed into a roadside pillar and used gasoline to set the vehicle and the deceased on fire to stage an accident.
Minh then fled the scene to Dong Xoai City, Binh Phuoc Province, the local media reported.
The Dak Nong police have yet to determine the level of involvement of his family members in the incident.
On May 4, the wreckage of the pickup truck and its burned occupant were found on National Highway 28.
Minh was arrested in Binh Phuoc Province on May 10.
Doctors discuss lung transplant for Covid-19 infected British pilot.
Doctors from Vietnam's top hospitals are considering moving a Covid-19-infected British pilot, who remains in critical condition, from HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases to Cho Ray Hospital, also in the city, for a possible lung transplant operation.
The 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot was hospitalized on March 18 and remains the most critical Covid-19 case in Vietnam.
He tested negative for the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, several times during treatment but then tested positive again a few days later.
Lung ultrasound scans showed that both his lungs have suffered extensive damage, according to the Ministry of Health, and he is reportedly experiencing cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system, causing it to attack even healthy cells and organs.
During more than 50 days in treatment, he has been on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine for 34 days as his lungs are unable to function fully.
He is also resistant to all coagulant drugs currently in use in the country, so the Ministry of Health had to order rare drugs from abroad for his treatment.
The doctors noted that he is 1.83 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms, with a body mass index of 30.1, so he is slightly obese.
Luong Ngoc Khue, director of the Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, under the Ministry of Health, said that due to the patient's weight, it is hard to find suitable organs for a lung transplant.
The difference in size between the donated organ and the patient's organ should not exceed 20%, not to mention immunity and other biochemical factors, he said.
The Ministry of Health has asked the Vietnam National Coordinating Center for Human Organ Transplantation to work with Cho Ray Hospital, HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Central Lung Hospital, and other hospitals that have successfully performed lung transplants such as 103 Hospital, 108 Hospital, and Vietnam-Germany Hospital to prepare for the patient's lung transplant.
Ministry to set up research group on cryptocurrency to tighten management.
The Ministry of Finance has decided to set up a research group which would be in charge of studying and proposing policies to manage virtual assets and crypto currencies.
The group had nine members, lead by Phạm Hồng Sơn, deputy chairman of the State Securites Commission.
Other members are from the State Securities Commission, the General Department of Taxation, State Bank of Việt Nam's Department of Banking and Financial Institutions and Legal Department, Việt Nam Customs and the National Institute for Việt Nam Finance.
Policies to effectively manage virtual assets were crucial in the context that virtual assets were developing rapidly but posing risks and might cause negative impacts on the market.
On August 21, 2017, the Prime Minister issued Decision No 1255 QĐ-TTg to approve the project about completing the legal framework for managing virtual assets, crypto currencies and electronic currencies.
On April 11, 2018, Directive No 10 CT-TT was issued with the aim to enhance management on transactions related to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies to put it under control and minimise their negative impacts.
Governor of the State Bank of Việt Nam on April 13, 2018 issued Directive No 02 CT-NHNN about measures to strengthen control over transactions related to crypto currencies in which credit institutions were asked not to supply some types of transactions related to virtual currencies to ensure compliance with established regulations about anti-money laundering and forex management.
According to crypto currrency market research company CrytoCompare, at the end of November 2017, about 80 per cent of Bitcoin transactions were found to originate from Asia, mainly from China, Japan, Republic of Korea and Việt Nam.
Access from Việt Nam to crypto currency websites and trading platforms were in the top five highest in the world, beside the US, Russia and Japan.
Bruce Jones, co-founder and CEO of Triton Submarines, remarked, The Triton DeepView 24 with its panoramic views represents a quantum leap forward in submarine technology, providing a vastly improved, fully immersive guest experience.
The Triton DeepView 24 submarine was assembled at Triton's manufacturing facility in Barcelona, where it successfully passed sea trials in March, according to DailyMail.
Hue offers 50% discount on sightseeing fees to stimulate tourism.
The central province of Thua Thien-Hue has approved a post-Covid-19 tourism stimulation program, offering up to 50% discounts on entrance tickets to visit world heritage sites from now to July 31, 2020, among other tourist incentives.
The new pricing was announced by Nguyen Van Phuc, Deputy Director of the Thua Thien-Hue Department of Tourism, following a meeting of the provincial People's Council on May 8.
During the meeting, tourism figures were discussed.
In January, the province's tourism industry reported the number of arrivals and revenue had year-on-year growth of 22.07% and 14.89%, respectively.
However, the coronavirus outbreak has had a heavy impact on the industry.
Many of travel companies, hotels, restaurants and shops have had to temporarily suspend their businesses, and thousands of industry workers have lost their jobs.
In the first four months of this year, the province attracted 940,069 tourists, down 50% year-on-year.
The direct tourism revenue was VND859 billion, a decrease of 21%, while the combined revenue was VND2,079 billion, down 45%, as Thua Thien-Hue lost some VND2,250 billion in tourism revenue.
Thus, apart from solutions to support enterprises suffering from the downturn caused by the epidemic, it is necessary to put in place the tourism stimulation program.
On Vietnam's Reunification Day (April 30) and May Day, thanks to free-of-charge offers for visiting world heritage sites, the province attracted 22,000 tourists following the social-distancing period.
Due to the promising results, the province decided to discount entrance fees by 50% from May 8 to July 31 this year.
The promotion might continue into the remainder of 2020, depending upon the world's tourism recovery.
The provincial tourism industry also encourages tourism companies to provide their own stimulation packages to attract more tourists.
At the meeting, leaders also discussed the national travel summit, to be held in Thua Thien-Hue later this month to seek collaboration among hotels, travel companies and restaurants, as well as cooperation by three central localities, including Quang Nam Province and Danang City.
Officials noted that tourist promotions will be held this year and next year, including Festival Hue 2020, Hue Ao dai Festival and Hue Hiphop Festival.
China reports first coronavirus case in Wuhan since April 3 among 14 new infections.
China's National Health Commission reported 14 new confirmed coronavirus cases on May 9, the highest number since April 28.
Jilin officials on Sunday raised the Shulan city risk level to high from medium after one woman tested positive on May 7.
The 11 new cases made public on Sunday are members of her family or people who came into contact with her or family members.
The new Wuhan case, the first reported in the epicentre of China's outbreak since April 3, was previously asymptomatic, according to the health commission.
Aside from the Shulan cluster and the Wuhan case, the remaining two new confirmed cases were imported infections.
It also said newly discovered asymptomatic cases were at 20, the highest since May 1 and up from 15 a day earlier.
No new deaths were reported, it said.
The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in mainland China reached 82,901 as of May 9, while the total death toll from the virus stood at 4,633, according to the commission.
Vietnamese professor wins Europe math prize.
Prof. Phan Thanh Nam has become the first Vietnamese professor to win the European Mathematical Society (EMS) prize.
Prof. Nam, 35, is a former student of the National University of HCMC.
He is currently a math professor at the Ludwig Maximillian University in Munich, Germany.
Nam's research interests include mathematical physics analysis, especially multi-particle quantum mechanics, spectral theory, variational calculation, derivative equations and calculus.
Before becoming a professor in Germany, Nam was an assistant professor in Masaryk, Czech Republic and a member of Austria's Science and Technology Society.
He has been invited twice to address the International Convention of Mathematical Physics.
In 2018, he was awarded a prize by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) for his work in mathematical physics research.
The EMS prizes are considered the second most prestigious mathematics award after the Field Medal of the International Mathematical Union (IMU).
Since established in 1992, the EMS prizes are awarded every four years at the European Congress of Mathematics (ECM).
At each ECM up to ten EMS prizes are awarded to young researchers not older than 35 years, who are European citizens or working in Europe, in recognition of excellent contributions in mathematics.
This year, the prize-giving ceremony will not be held as usual at the European Congress of Mathematics (ECM) because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
It has been postponed until June 2021.
Two Dong Nai senior cops with greased palms disciplined.
On May 8, Dong Nai Police decided to take the disciplinary action of transferring Lt. Col. Pham Hai Cang (Team 2 vice-captain) and Lt. Col. Phan Cam Tu (Team 1 vice-captain) out of the traffic department to the mobile police unit for letting vehicles violating traffic regulations to go free.
Two Dong Nai traffic cops accused their superiors, Cang and Tu, of frequently letting violators off the hook because they have paid the team.
According to a traffic police captain who had worked with Team 2 of the Dong Nai Police Department, the unit responsible for patrolling National Highway 20 that connects the province with the Central Highlands' Da Lat Town, his patrol had arrested overloaded vehicles many times, only for superiors to let them go because they had paid.
Just minutes after they made the arrest, a leader of Team 2 would call, name the registration number of the overloaded vehicle, and order the patrol team to let it go.
Two months later, Cang and Tu were suspended from work.
After verification of the allegations, Major General Nguyen Ngoc Hieu, Deputy Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Public Security, had said that there are reasons to believe that the two senior cops were guilty.
Vietnam busts $858 mln online gambling ring, 21 arrested.
An online gambling ring worth VND20 trillion ($858.3 million) was busted by the Ministry of Public Security Wednesday, leading to 21 arrests.
The ring, led by 28-year-old Nguyen Thi Huong Ly and 24-year-old Nguyen Duc Manh, utilized online gambling methods under the guise of games like poker and lottery, the ministry said.
The ring had servers overseas and cooperated with several clients inside Vietnam.
The clients in Vietnam used phone numbers and social media for players to contact and transact with them.
Players transferred cash into bank accounts provided by the clients, or paid through top-up cards.
Ly was in charge of creating clients' accounts on the ring's website for players to perform transactions.
She traveled from Hanoi to Saigon last month to rent a location for her accomplices.
She and Manh guided several people in using their personal bank accounts to perform transactions and play the games on offer.
The total amount of money transacted by the gambling ring since January last year amounted to around VND20 trillion, police said.
Ly, Manh, and 18 others were arrested by police in Hanoi and Saigon on Wednesday.
Vietnam has relaxed its stance on gambling as a social evil, legalizing sports betting in 2017 and allowing, on a pilot basis, people aged over 21 with a monthly income of at least VND10 million ($432) to play in a casino on the southern Phu Quoc Island.
But all other forms of gambling remain illegal.
Women leaders are handling the pandemic brilliantly.
Why aren't there more of them?
In Taiwan, early intervention measures have controlled the coronavirus pandemic so successfully that it is now exporting millions of face masks to help the European Union and others.
Germany has overseen the largest-scale coronavirus testing program in Europe, conducting 350,000 tests each week, detecting the virus early enough to isolate and treat patients effectively.
In New Zealand, the prime minister took early action to shut down tourism and impose a month-long lockdown on the entire country, limiting coronavirus casualties to just four deaths.
All three places have received accolades for their impressive handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
They are scattered across the globe.
one is in the heart of Europe, one is in Asia and the other is in the South Pacific.
But they have one thing in common.
they're all led by women.
The success of these and other women-led governments in dealing with a global pandemic is all the more noteworthy, given that women make up less than 7% of world leaders.
These countries -- all multi-party democracies with high levels of public trust in their governments -- have contained the pandemic through early, scientific intervention.
They have implemented widespread testing, easy access to quality medical treatment, aggressive contact tracing and tough restrictions on social gatherings.
It's too early to say definitively which leaders will emerge as having taken enough of the right steps to control the spread of coronavirus -- and save lives.
But the examples above show that a disproportionately large number of leaders who acted early and decisively were women.
Amid a severe heat wave, consistently high UV levels have been threatening major Vietnamese cities, with the index jumping to 'dangerous level' this weekend.
Data from Weather Online, a U.K.-based meteorological services provider, indicate the index in Ho Chi Minh City would climb to a 'very high' level of 10 on Saturday and 11 on Sunday, a dangerous level posing health risks to holiday-goers engaged in outdoor activities.
American forecast services provider AccuWeather said the city's UV would reach 9, also a very high level, on Saturday and 12 on Sunday.
Data from Weather Online also showed the UV index in Da Nang City in central Vietnam would rise to 11 this weekend while AccuWeather said it would reach 13 on Saturday and Sunday.
The region has been battered by a severe heat wave over the past days.
Weather agencies forecast the UV index in Hanoi would reach 12 this Saturday but deem down to moderate levels on Sunday, thanks to a couple thunderstorms.
A heatwave began affecting northern, north-central, and central localities on Monday, raising the mercury across these regions to between 35 and 38 degrees Celsius, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
From Thursday until the weekend, the heat wave would continue hitting southern regions and the Central Highlands as well as south central provinces with temperatures reaching 35-37 degrees Celsius from noon to 3 p.m., it added.
Capital Hanoi braced as the temperature reached up to 35-37 degrees Celsius this week and is expected to stay there during the weekend, according to AccuWeather, which said real feel temperatures can reach 44 degrees Celsius on Saturday and drop to 42 degrees Celsius.
Weather Online said Hanoi's temperatures would reach 34-35 degrees Celsius this weekend while Vietnam's national forecast center said some places in the city can be affected by 40 degrees Celsius.
Statistics show since the beginning of the year, the average temperature across Vietnam reached 1 to 2.5 degrees Celsius higher than previous years, with the upward trend forecast to last till October.
Major heat waves are forecast to hit northern provinces in May and June, while scorching hot temperatures in north-central and central provinces will last till August.
Experts have advised residents to avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 10 a.m and 3 p.m and to wear sunscreen, sunglasses and brimmed hats if venturing out under the sun.
According to Le Thi Xuan Lan, a weather pundit based in southern Vietnam, a tropical depression is likely to form in the Pacific Ocean near the Philippines in early May, which will result in rain falling across multiple areas, including southern regions.
The rainy season is hoped to alleviate drought and saltwater intrusion that plaguing provinces in southern and central regions over the past months, Lan added.
On March 24 Việt Nam capped exports of rice to ensure food security after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.
It is the world's third-largest exporter after India and Thailand.
Last year the country exported 6.37 million tonnes worth US$2.81 billion, with its top markets being the Philippines (2.1 million tonnes), Ivory Coast (580,000 tonnes), Malaysia (550,000 tonnes), and China (477,000 tonnes).
Exports in the first two months of this year had topped 890,000 tonnes and fetched $410 million, increases of 27 per cent and 32.6 per cent year-on-year.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the country is projected to grow 43.5 million tonnes of the grain this year, nearly 30 million tonnes of which will be used for domestic consumption and the rest will be exported.
Binh Thuan declares drought emergency.
Given the prolonged heat wave in the region, tens of thousands of residents in Binh Thuan Province are facing a shortage of water, prompting the provincial government to declare a drought emergency.
With the drought worsening, Nguyen Ngoc Hai, chairman of the south-central coastal province of Binh Thuan, on May 7 signed the decision on the level-two emergency.
The province's chairman told the Binh Thuan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to collaborate with the relevant agencies to determine which areas had been affected by the drought and to adopt response measures quickly.
Certain construction projects, among other things, need to be started to ensure an adequate water supply for daily use and the water volume of reservoirs must be closely monitored, the local media reported.
A report by the Binh Thuan Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue showed that over the past six months, there has been no rain in Binh Thuan Province.
The prolonged scorching heat has resulted in the destruction of some 15,000 hectares of crops.
Besides this, the drought has left 25,000 households holding 93,000 people without sufficient clean water.
Rivers, streams and drilling wells in the Ham Tan, Tanh Linh and Duc Linh districts have dried up, along with reservoirs in the province, including Ba Bau, Song Mong, Ta Mon and Da Bac.
Severe water shortages have hit the Ham Tan, Ham Thuan Nam and Ham Thuan Bac districts in the province.
Residents in many parts of Binh Thuan Province have had to buy water from other areas at prices ranging from VND80,000 to VND120,000 per cubic meter to serve their daily activities.
Vingroup to give 2,400 ventilators to Russia and Ukraine.
Vingroup will give 2,400 invasive ventilators to Russia and Ukraine to help treat COVID-19 cases in the two countries between May 15 to August 30.
The embassy of the Russian Federation in Việt Nam and the embassy of Ukraine in Việt Nam signed an agreement to receive the ventilators on May 6 in Hà Nội.
The invasive ventilators include Vsmart VFS-410 and VFS-510, the two made in Vietnam invasive ventilators which have been completed and manufactured entirely within the Vingroup ecosystem, with a localisation rate of up to 70 per cent.
Nguyễn Việt Quang, Vice Chairman and CEO of Vingroup said that.
By giving 2,400 invasive ventilators, Vingroup hopes to actively contribute to the effective treatment of medical forces in Russia and Ukraine for patients and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This shows the gratitude of the Group's management to the two countries for their close connection with the start-up process of Vingroup.
In detail, Vingroup will give Russia 1,000 VFS-410 ventilators and 500 VFS-510 ventilators.
while giving Ukraine 600 VFS-410 ventilators and 300 VFS-510 ventilators.
The VFS-410 and VFS-510 ventilators are currently being assessed by quality management agencies and the Medical Council of Vietnam, ensuring compliance with quality standards for product circulation in Viet Nam.
At the same time, Vingroup is promoting the supply of ventilator models for Russia and Ukraine to carry out quality inspection procedures in accordance with their current regulations.
The group will officially hand over 2,400 ventilators after being granted product circulation licences by Russia and Ukraine.
Up to now, Vingroup is one of the pioneering enterprises in Asia in sponsoring and supporting the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with a total sponsorship fund of nearly VNĐ600 billion (US$25.7 million) excluding funding for investment in manufacturing ventilators.
According to the worldometers.info statistics, by 7am May 6, 2020, there are more than 3.7 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 258,000 deaths around the world.
Russia is gradually becoming the current hotspot of COVID-19, with a total of 155,370 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and 1,451 deaths.
While Ukraine's Ministry of Health reported a total of 12,697 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 316 deaths as of May 6.
Trump thanks Vietnam for medical supplies and gifts.
U.S President Donald Trump, speaking in a phone conversation with Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on May 6 (Hanoi time), thanked Vietnam and its people for medical supplies and gifts for the United States and American people.
The conversation was conducted at the request of the U.S side, according to the Vietnam News Agency.
Trump highly valued Vietnam's Covid-19 response and expressed his appreciation of Vietnam's facilitation of the supply and transportation of medical supplies to America and its donations of face masks to American frontline workers.
The two countries should continue working together in the fight against Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, he said.
Phuc updated Trump on Vietnam's Covid-19 prevention and control effort and expressed his sympathies over the losses and difficulties that the Americans are facing due to the disease.
However, he said he believes that under the leadership of President Trump, the U.S will be able to put the disease under control and reopen its economy soon.
Phuc hailed the bilateral cooperation between the two nations in combating Covid-19, and thanked the U.S President for offering to present ventilators to Vietnam and providing financial support for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including nearly US$10 million for Vietnam to improve health care capacity and rehabilitate the economy.
Both sides agreed to step up bilateral economic and trade ties and open up their markets for their goods in the time to come.
Two-way trade between the countries continued to expand in the first quarter of 2020, with U.S exports to Vietnam growing 17% over the same period last year.
The two leaders also exchanged views on how to deepen the bilateral comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and America, especially on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties.
Trump affirmed that the U.S attaches importance to the comprehensive partnership with Vietnam, and said that the Vietnam-U.S relationship has strongly grown over the past 25 years.
On March 26 and April 28, the two leaders exchanged letters on Covid-19.
On the same day, at the request of the U.S side, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh had a phone conversation with U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The two sides agreed that Vietnam-U.S relations have continued expanding in various aspects, especially economy and trade.
They also agreed to work together to organize cooperation activities on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 2020, thus deepening the Vietnam-U.S comprehensive partnership.
Pompeo hailed Vietnam's role in responding to common challenges, and agreed to boost coordination to promote ties between ASEAN and the U.S while Vietnam is serving as the ASEAN 2020 Chair and a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Vietnamese Covid-19 vaccine shows initial effect on mice.
50 mice in the lab remain healthy 10 days after being administered a Covid-19 vaccine produced in Vietnam.
The latest vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at the Company for Vaccine and Biological Production No.1 (VABIOTECH) and the U.K.'s Bristol University.
Dr. Do Tuan Dat, President of VABIOTECH in Hanoi, said.
This is the initial success in the development of Covid-19 vaccine in Vietnam.
Dat said that during the testing phase, researchers experimented by injecting the mice in many ways and administering multiple antigen doses, with some mice injected with one or two doses of 3-10 micrograms each.
After 10 days, the mice are in good health and being closely monitored for immune responses, he said.
Over the next four or five days, researchers will send the mice's blood samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology for first evaluation and the second in the next 14 days.
This is an important stage of research on the Covid-19 vaccine in Vietnam.
If the test is successful on mice, the research team will take their work further and seek funding from international agencies.
According to Dat, the main ingredient in the vaccine is a strain carrying Covid-19 antigens that scientists successfully generated in the lab and tested on other animals with good results.
So it is reasonable to expect the vaccine given to mice is also safe, he said.
After gaining positive results with immune response and antibody production, researchers will continue to develop complete vaccines and production technologies on many different scales, he added.
The institute estimates it will take at least 12-18 months to develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can work safely on humans.
A vaccine is generally considered the most effective way to fight a viral disease.
There are currently no approved vaccines or medication for the Covid-19, which has killed more than 265,600 people worldwide and infected more than 3.8 million.
Around 150 Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being conducted worldwide.
In the past, Vietnamese scientists also studied and developed a number of effective vaccines, including the polio vaccine, the oral cholera vaccine, and the H5N1 bird flu vaccine.
Vietnam recorded 17 new Covid-19 patients on Thursday evening, all Vietnamese repatriated from the UAE.
The additions raised Vietnam's infection tally to 288.
Of these, 233 have recovered and been discharged and 55 are still under treatment.
Vietnam has 17 new coronavirus cases, all from same flight.
The Ministry of Health reported 17 new coronavirus cases today, May 7, all of whom are Vietnamese returning to the Mekong Delta province of Bac Lieu from the United Arab Emirates on flight VN0088 on May 3.
Six of the patients are male and 11 are female, including three people of a family who lived with a coronavirus patient when they were in Dubai.
They are aged between 20 and 58, except a months-old child.
They were on the same flight with 280 other passengers.
All of them, as well as the flight crew, were put under quarantine on arriving in Bac Lieu Province and their samples were taken to the Pasteur Institute HCMC for coronavirus test.

China repatriates 30 illegal Vietnamese farmworkers.
China has sent back 30 illegal Vietnamese farmworkers, and they have been quarantined for 14 days to ensure they do not have Covid-19.
Border forces in China's Yunnan Province last Saturday handed over the eight men and 22 women to their counterparts in Lao Cai Province.
The workers, many of them ethnic H'Mong people, had reportedly crossed into China through paths looking for jobs on banana and rubber farms in Yunnan since November last year.
When the Covid-19 pandemic began in December Chinese authorities sought to identify foreign workers to contain the spread of the virus and found these Vietnamese had entered illegally.
They placed them in detention for more than three months before sending them home.
At the Lao Cai border, the returnees had to make health declarations and were then sent to a quarantine center for 14 days.
Lao Cai has set up 13 quarantine centers.
Last month it received 500 workers returning from China, border authorities said.
They went to that country legally, but had to return since Chinese factories have been laying off workers due to the impact of the pandemic.
China, where Covid-19 first broke out in Wuhan City last December before spreading to 211 other countries and territories around the world, has reported more than 82,000 cases of infection and 4,633 deaths.
Discharged Covid-19 patient dies of liver cirrhosis in Vietnam.
A 64-year-old man from Ha Nam Province, who was discharged after testing Covid-19 negative four times, died last Friday of liver cirrhosis, the Health Ministry said Monday night.
Patient 251, who tested positive for the virus on April 7, was treated at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi.
He was discharged from the hospital on April 17 after testing negative four times in a row and transferred to the Ha Nam General Hospital in the northern province of Ha Nam for treatment of liver cirrhosis.
Since March 20, he had been treated at the Ha Nam General Hospital's gastroenterology department for liver cirrhosis, exhaustion, and severe gout.
The patient went comatose due to severe impairment of liver function and electrolyte disturbance before his death.
After the patient died, the Ha Nam General Hospital carried out a Covid-19 test and the result came back negative.
The patient did not have any symptoms of lung damage caused by Covid-19, doctors said.

PM officially gives green light to export of medical face masks.
Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has given the green light to the export of medical face masks without any caps on export volume so that Việt Nam would not miss out on the opportunity of becoming the world's face mask factory amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Government's Resolution No 60 NQ-CP dated April 29 removed Resolution No 20's regulation on licences for export of medical face masks.
Under Resolution 20 dated February 20, medical face masks could only be exported for international aid and assistance provided by the Government with export volume capped at 25 percent of the producer's total output.
The Prime Minister also asked the ministry to propose appropriate measures on managing medical face masks based on the development of the pandemic and the domestic demand to ensure adequate supply for the domestic market.
In addition, the ministries of health, and industry and trade must make public the list of face mask producers and their production capacity and export volume.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) must enhance management and inspection to prevent speculation of face masks and raw materials as well as the production of poor-quality products.
Producers must be responsible for their product quality and pledge to supply medical organizations when required.
Customs statistics showed that Việt Nam exported 415.7 million face masks worth US$63.19 million from January 1 to April 19, mainly to Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany, and the US.
According to the MoIT, 50 domestic producers which reported to the ministry alone had a total production capacity of eight million face masks per day.
Films that aren't released in theaters are still able to contend for the 2021 Oscars.
The acute respiratory infection pandemic, COVID-19 has caused Hollywood's movie capital to face an unprecedented fact,which is that all films released in 2020 may not be shown at theaters.
In addition, the U.S movie theaters have been closed since mid-March, it remains unclear when they will be reopened.
Therefore, on April 28, it was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) that made a decision to make an important change to the rules on how they will consider films for this award, which films that aren't released in theaters are still eligible for the 2021 Oscars.
According to the traditional Oscars rules, what AMPAS stipulates is that a film would have to be shown at least 7 days in movie theaters in order to be considered for the world's most prestigious film award.
Once movie theaters are reopened, AMPAS will make the next decision on when to stop the above-mentioned flexible rule.
Vietnam tests Covid-19 vaccine on mice.
The Covid-19 vaccine was developed after scientists successfully generated the novel coronavirus antigen in the lab, said Dr. Do Tuan Dat, President of the Company for Vaccine and Biological Production No.1 (VABIOTECH) in Hanoi.
Antigen units are the most important ingredient in vaccine production, helping the body process antigens.
After testing the vaccine in mice for two weeks, scientists will conduct blood tests on the animal, sending samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.
Dat said the vaccine will be tested further in animals and evaluated for safety and effectiveness before a manufacturing process is embarked on.
The vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at VABIOTECH and the U.K.'s Bristol University.
A vaccine is said to be the most effective way to fight against a viral disease.
Produced from weakened virus or a protein or other small pieces taken from it, a vaccine trains the body's immune system to fight the disease it has not come into contact with before.
There are currently no approved vaccines or medication for the Covid-19, which has killed nearly 245,000 people worldwide and infected almost 3.5 million.
Around 150 Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being conducted worldwide.
Big breakfasts help us burn double the calories.
Researchers have revealed what might be a highly popular new way to lose weight - eat a big breakfast.
It could become the biggest diet fad ever for those wishing to shed a few kilos.
Scientists in Germany conducted a study on how a hearty breakfast affected the body's metabolism in a laboratory experiment.
Sixteen men ate a low-calorie breakfast and high-calorie dinner one day, and reversed this with a high-calorie breakfast and low-calorie dinner the next.
Eating a larger breakfast and a smaller dinner boosted a process called diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT).
This is the generation of heat in the body that burns up calories.
This happened even when the total calories consumed throughout the day remained the same.
Eating a big breakfast led to 2.5 times higher rates of DIT.
Researcher Dr Juliane Richter spoke about the findings of her investigation.
She said, Our results show a meal eaten for breakfast, regardless of the number of calories it contains, creates twice as high DIT as the same meal consumed for dinner.
This finding is significant for all people as it underlines the value of eating enough at breakfast.
Vietnam reports new coronavirus case tonight.
A British oil expert has tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the country's total number of confirmed cases to 271 tonight, May 3, according to the Ministry of Health.
The 37-year-old man, who works at Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam), arrived at HCMC-based Tan Son Nhat International Airport, with 12 other experts on April 28.
After their arrival, they were sent to a quarantine center in the city's outlying district of Can Gio, thus posing no risks for community spread.
All the experts first tested negative for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, on April 28.
However, the second test results showed one, now the 271st patient, had the virus on May 2.
The patient is being treated at the city's Cu Chi Field Hospital.
Among 271 Covid-19 patients, 219 cases have made a full recovery and there have been no coronavirus fatalities, the local media reported.
China is trying to revive its economy without risking more lives.
China is trying to jump-start its huge economy without triggering a second wave of coronavirus cases.
It's a high-stakes experiment that could provide clues for countries agonizing over how long to keep their shutdowns in place as a global recession begins and millions of jobs are lost.
The country where the pandemic began was almost completely shut down in late January as the number of coronavirus cases mounted.
The drastic measures appear to have brought the virus under control.
Locally transmitted infections have plummeted, and a lockdown on most of Hubei province — ground zero of the pandemic — is being lifted this week.
But the lockdown also brought activity in much of the world's second biggest economy to a standstill for weeks on end, and is likely to result in China's first contraction in decades.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently forecast that China's GDP may fall by 9% in the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2019.
The Chinese government knows that its actions to contain the virus came at the expense of the country's economic health.
Now authorities are trying to ensure that those consequences are short lived.
The economic losses have become intolerable, Xingdong (XD) Chen, chief China economist for BNP Paribas, told CNN Business, adding that the government has to balance resuming work while remaining vigilant.
I don't think it is right to restart business and production only when the virus has totally disappeared.
Vietnam ends 16th day without Covid-19 community transmission.
The Health Ministry confirmed no new coronavirus cases Saturday evening, marking the 16th consecutive day Vietnam has gone without community transmission of Covid-19.
Of the 270 patients recorded so far, 217 have been discharged and 53 are undergoing treatment, including 14 relapsed patients.
Of the relapses, five are in Hanoi and six in Ho Chi Minh City including the latest two cases confirmed Saturday.
The northern province of Quang Ninh has reported two relapsed patients and the south central province of Binh Thuan one.
So far, Vietnam has gone eight days without new infections.
The latest patients, announced last Friday evening, were both students studying in Japan who returned to the Van Don Airport in Quang Ninh on April 22.
They were quarantined on arrival and are now under treatment at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi.
Nearly 30,000 people are quarantined in the country – 244 in hospitals specialized for Covid-19 treatment, over 5,500 at centralized facilities and the rest at home.
The health ministry also said Saturday that three critically-ill Covid-19 patients in Vietnam have overcome the most difficult stage.
The Covid-19 pandemic has spread to 212 countries and territories, with almost 240,000 deaths reported so far.
Việt Nam exports nearly 416 million face masks.
Việt Nam exported 415.7 million face masks worth US$63.19 million from January 1 to April 19, according to the General Department of Customs.
Between April 1 and 19 there were 88.19 million face masks worth $344 million exported, including 51.3 million that were gifts and donations.
Japan was the biggest importer of made-in-Vietnam face masks in the period, with 32.7 million, followed by the Republic of Korea, Germany, and the US, with 17.1 million, 11.1 million, and 10.4 million, respectively.
In early April, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc approved the export of medical face masks and protective clothing, as long as domestic demand, including reserves, is met first.
Such products can therefore only be exported to countries that have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Ministry of Health's figures showed that there are some 68 companies producing medical face masks and protective clothing in Việt Nam.
Some garment companies are also investing in producing medical face masks, besides cloth face masks, such as the Garment 10 Corporation Joint Stock Company and TNG Investment and Trading Joint Stock Company.
The Vietnam Trade Office in the EU has warned that the mass production of medical face masks and protective clothing that do not follow technical standards will cause oversupply and damage if such products cannot be exported.
Trần Thanh Hải, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Industry and Trade's Import-Export Department, urged face mask producers to pay attention to quality and safety requirements and obtain the necessary certificates for export.

Alibaba Demotes Tmall Boss Jiang Fan, Says Personal Scandal Damaged Company Reputation.
Alibaba announced on April 27 that Jiang Fan, the head of its e-commerce business units and a partner at the company, will be demoted as a punishment for his personal scandals damaging the company's image.
Jiang will be removed as one of the company's 38 partners, and demoted from Senior Vice President to VP, down one level from M7 to M6, according to Alibaba's internal managerial level guidebook.
He will also be deprived of all bonuses from the previous financial year.
Jiang will still keep his job as the head of Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall, two of China's leading e-commerce websites.
Earlier this month, Dong Yang, wife of the executive, accused of Zhang Dayi, a popular Chinese influencer who also runs several fashion-focused companies that operate on Alibaba's platforms, of seducing Jiang.
Ruhnn Holdings, Zhang's holding company, owns several of the top performing shops on Tmall and Taobao, and was invested by Alibaba in 2016.
An internal investigation that began two weeks ago found that dealings between Ruhnn Holdings and the business units Jiang leads did not show signs of misconduct, such as profit transferring.
Jiang was not included in the decision that led to Alibaba investing in Ruhnn Holdings.
The investigation found, however, that Jiang's failure to properly handle his family affairs had caused a public opinion crisis and severely damaged the company's reputation.
Jiang, 35, is one of the youngest top executives at Alibaba.
Started as an engineer in Google China, he later went on to co-found Umeng, the mobile-focused data services provider that Alibaba acquired in 2013.
Jiang became the president of Taobao in 2017, and took over Tmall in 2019.
Jiang is also a member of Alibaba's strategic execution committee.

Vice Chairman of the province Lai Thanh Son said the provincial authorities have worked closely with traders and farmers to ensure the farming processes and litchi quality meet Japan's requirements and to help them manage their processing, packaging and sterilization system.
All preparations for litchi exports to Japan are nearly complete.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan wrote to the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in mid-December 2019 approving the import of Vietnam's litchis following five years of talks between the two sides.
Previously, Japan had opened its market to Vietnamese dragon fruit and mangoes.
Bac Giang Province is the largest producer of litchis in Vietnam, with 28,000 hectares of land and an estimated yield of 160,000 tons.
Some 15,000 hectares (53%) meet the VietGAP standard and 80 hectares meet the GlobalGAP standard.
The province also ships litchis to China, the United States and the European Union.
South Korean officials call for caution amid reports that North Korean leader Kim is ill.
South Korean officials are calling for caution amid reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may be ill, emphasising that they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea.
At a closed door forum on Sunday, South Korea's Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, said the government has the intelligence capabilities to say with confidence that there was nothing unusual happening.
Rumours and speculation over the North Korean leader's health began after he made no public appearance at a key state holiday on April 15, and has since remained out of sight.
South Korea media last week reported that Kim may have undergone cardiovascular surgery or was in isolation to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus.
On Monday, North Korean state media once again showed no new photos of Kim nor reported on his whereabouts.
However, they did carry reports that he had sent a message of gratitude to workers building a tourist resort in Wonsan, an area where some South Korean media reports have said Kim may be staying.
Last week China dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un.
Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Kim's health.
On Friday a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim Jong Un was alive and would likely make an appearance soon.
Experts have cautioned that Kim has disappeared from state media coverage before, and that gathering accurate information in North Korea is notoriously difficult.
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11.
Kim, believed to be 36, vanished from state media for more than a month in 2014 and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.
China sent team including medical experts to advise on North Korea's Kim.
China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader.
Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signaled in terms of Kim's health.
A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday.
The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.
The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.
Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12.
South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.
On Thursday, U.S President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Kim was gravely ill.
I think the report was incorrect, Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.
On Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon.
An official familiar with U.S intelligence said that Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.
A U.S State department spokeswoman had no comment.
U.S Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim's health on Fox News after Trump spoke said, I don't have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we're watching the situation very keenly.
North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security.
Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Kim's whereabouts or condition.
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11.
Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before.
In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.
Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.
When Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.
Five dead as flashfloods, landslides hit northern Vietnam.
Heavy floods and landslides triggered by torrential rains in northern Vietnam over the past three days have left five dead and over 10,300 houses damaged.
From April 22 to 24, a cold spell combined with the convergence of high winds caused heavy rain in the northern mountainous region, with rainfall in many areas of up to 130 mm a day.
Lai Chau Province reported two deaths while Ha Giang, Son La and Yen Bai reported one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.
Twenty-five others have been injured and some are still missing, the committee said.
The total damage so far is estimated at VND130 billion ($5.5 million), with 10,330 houses damaged and over 3,000 hectares of rice and other crops destroyed.
Lai Chau has issued flash flood and landslide warnings to all areas, and residents of some houses in vulnerable locations haver been evacuated to safer areas.
The National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting said northern mountainous provinces will experience heavy rains until Sunday.
Lai Chau, Dien Bien and Lao Cai provinces are at high risk of flashfloods and landslides, it said.
Natural disasters, mostly floods and landslides, killed 133 people in Vietnam last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Nearly 10,000 overseas Vietnamese to return home to shun pandemic.
The health authority in HCMC has been told to be prepared to receive and quarantine an estimated 10,000 Vietnamese returnees from abroad amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Of these, 300 Vietnamese students in the United States are expected to arrive in the city through Tan Son Nhat International Airport on April 27, municipal chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong said at a meeting on Covid-19 infection prevention and control on April 24.
He asked the HCMC Health Department to take steps to send these returnees to isolation centers right after their arrival, reported Dan Tri newsite.
The city's leader cited examples of two Vietnamese students returning from Japan recently and testing positive for the new coronavirus, noting that extreme caution should be maintained during the fight against the coronavirus.
Speaking at the meeting, Nguyen Huu Hung, deputy director of the municipal Health Department, said that Vietnam National University HCMC's dormitory, which was requisitioned as a centralized isolation center, must be resumed to its original state soon, as students are to return to school soon.
Accordingly, agencies have to closely cooperate to set up additional quarantine facilities to assist with the city's efforts to combat Covid-19, Hung said.
To date, the city has reported 54 Covid-19 infections, with 53 cases having recovered.
The remaining Covid-19 case, confirmed as the 91st patient, is a British pilot who is under treatment at the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
Vietnam reports two new Covid-19 cases after eight days.
The Ministry of Health, April 24, confirmed two new coronavirus cases after eight consecutive days without any new case reported.
Up to now, Vietnam has reported 270 coronavirus cases, with 245 of them having recovered.
Two new cases are Vietnamese students returning home from Japan on April 21.
The 269th patient is a 23-year-old man residing in Viet Yen District, Bac Giang Province, while the 270th patient is a 22-year-old woman in Yen Dung District in the same province.
They were on the same flight with 160 other passengers residing in 32 cities and provinces.
All of them were transported to Thai Binh Province for quarantine right after arriving at Van Don Airport in Quang Ninh.
We took samples from the passengers for Covid-19 testing on April 21 and two of them tested positive.
The two patients are now being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, said Pham Van Diu, director of the Thai Binh Province Department of Health.
Forty-eight of the passengers are pregnant and seven are children, according to Diu.
Australian foreign minister condemns China's disruptive actions.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Thursday she was concerned about China's disruptive activities in the East Sea, including the sinking of a Vietnamese boat.
Australia was concerned over reported efforts to disrupt other countries' resource development activities, the declaration of new 'administrative districts' over disputed features, and the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat, reportedly in a collision with a Chinese coast guard vessel, by The Sydney Morning Herald.
They were her first comments on the issue in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea.
She said that Australia had a strong interest in the stability of this crucial waterway and the norms and laws that govern it.
It is vital at this time that all parties refrain from destabilizing activities and work to ease tensions so the international community can devote full attention to responding cooperatively to the Covid-19 pandemic, she said.
Australian frigate HMAS Parramatta has joined three U.S warships for an exercise in the South China Sea this week.
They arrived close to where the Chinese government survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 has been operating, Reuters reported.
The Chinese vessel was spotted inside sea areas about 352 km away from Bruneian and Malaysian coasts by ship tracking website Marine Traffic on April 16.
On April 14, it had reportedly appeared at 158 km (98 miles) off Vietnam's coast, within Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
HCMC stops taking test samples at airport, railway stations.
Having passed 16 days without a new patient being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in HCMC, the city's Center for Disease Control and Prevention today, April 23, has stopped taking samples from arriving passengers at Saigon Railway Station and Tan Son Nhat International Airport for Covid-19 testing.
The city is still checking the body temperatures of people arriving at 62 checkpoints.
From April 4 to 22, the city center took over 13,800 samples from travelers at the airport and some 5,600 samples from travelers at the railway station, the local media reported.
The test results of these samples, except for the sample of the 22nd case, who tested positive for the virus after being discharged from a hospital in Danang City, came back negative for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, proving there was no risk of community spread.
Nguyen Tri Dung, director of the city center, noted that the city is treating only two coronavirus patients at the moment, with one having tested negative for Covid-19 three times and the other being the 91st case, a British pilot working for Vietnam Airlines.
The center is collaborating with the HCMC Food Safety Management Board to build a set of criteria to assess food safety and Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures applicable to factories and companies, said Dung.
Covid-19 fraud.
Hanoi CDC officials inflated test kit prices by $200,000.
For now, most real-time PRC machines are produced in Germany and several other European countries, and cost between VND2.5 billion and VND10 billion each, depending on their capacity and configuration.
Cam, the Hanoi CDC director, and six other suspects in the case were arrested Wednesday.
Police said the CDC officials had conspired to cheat and raise the price of a bidding package for the real-time PCR system.
Cam is under investigation along with Nguyen Vu Ha Thanh, head of the agency's financial accounting department.
Le Xuan Tuan, an employee of the department.
Dao The Vinh, director of the Vietnam Scientific and Material Science Company Limited.
Nguyen Tran Duy, director of the Nhan Thanh Property Valuation and Auction company.
Nguyen Ngoc Nhat, an employee of the Vitech Development Company Limited.
and Nguyen Thanh Tuyen, an employee of the Eastern Medical Equipment Company.
They will be probed on charges of violating bidding regulations causing serious consequences, an offence that can fetch jail terms of up to 20 years.
The Hanoi CDC has been in charge of Covid-19 testing for the entire capital city, with 2,500-3,000 samples taken each day.
VinAI Research announces state-of-the-art face recognition technology.
VinAI Research, under Vingroup, announced on April 20 that it has successfully developed state-of-the-art technology that allows users to use face recognition to unlock their devices without removing their face masks.
Designed with the principles of deep learning, VinAI's face recognition technology enables phone cameras to identify users even if their faces are partially covered.
VinAI said it is willing to share the technology free of charge with programs that contribute to coronavirus infection prevention and control.
Bui Hai Hung, director of VinAI Research, noted that face masks are an essential item for people during the coronavirus pandemic.
However, the accuracy of existing facial recognition technologies can be reduced by more than 50% if users wear face masks.
By using VinAI's face recognition technology, people can easily unlock their phones without having to remove their masks, thus preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
VinAI has also developed a solution that automatically monitors people wearing masks on cameras.
This solution will be helpful for organizations and companies when they resume operations after the pandemic.
Vietnam rejects China's sovereign claims in East Sea.
The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on April 23 that it has contacted the Chinese side to reaffirm Vietnam's standpoint on East Sea issues and reject China's illegal sovereignty claims over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes.
China has recently stepped up its assertiveness and illegal expansion in the disputed waters.
After a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel rammed into a Vietnamese fishing boat while it was fishing near the Paracel Archipelago in early April, China announced on April 18 the establishment of Xisha District on Paracel Archipelago and Nansha District on Spratly Archipelago.
On April 19, China officially published the names of 25 islands and reefs and 55 seafloor geographical entities, most of which are located on the two archipelagos.
China's Foreign Ministry has also sent a diplomatic note to the United Nations lodging stern representations in response to what it called Vietnam's illegal claims in the East Sea.
It also threatened any attempt to deny China's sovereignty there will be doomed to fail.
Responding to inquiries about reactions of Vietnam on China's recent moves at a press meeting on April 23,Ngo Toan Thang, deputy spokesperson of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Vietnam has submitted a claim to the United Nations to affirm its sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes in accordance with international laws.
China's recent expansions in the East Sea go against the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and seriously violate the sovereignty of Vietnam.
Vietnam has sufficient historical evidence and a legal foundation to assert its sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes, Thang said.
Earlier on April 19,Le Thi Thu Hang, spokesperson of Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, said Vietnam strongly protests China's establishment ofXisha and Nansha districts and put them under the jurisdiction of Sansha City.
China's establishment of the so-called Sansha City and related acts are invalid and unrecognized, and they are detrimental to the friendship between countries and will further complicate the situation in the East Sea, the region and the world, Hang said.
Vietnam passes one week with zero new Covid-19 cases.
Vietnam reported no fresh Covid-19 infections this morning, April 23, marking a full week in which the country's total number of coronavirus cases was kept unchanged at 268.
Of the total, 223 patients have made a full recovery and been discharged from hospital, according to the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control.
Among the 45 cases under treatment at eight medical centers, 11 patients have tested negative once or twice for the virus, the local media reported.
Meanwhile, the three critically ill patients, including the 19th and 161st receiving treatment at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Dong Anh District, Hanoi City and the 91st under treatment at HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases, have shown some health improvements.
Despite the positive signal, residents should not be inattentive and should continue to strictly follow Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures, including wearing face masks, avoiding mass gatherings and standing apart from one another, said Associate Professor Dr Tran Dac Phu, former head of the General Department of Preventive Medicine.
Germany makes face masks compulsory in public.
Germany's federal states on Wednesday announced new measures in fight against the coronavirus, making it mandatory to wear cloth masks while shopping and in public transport, starting from April 27.
Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia announced that all citizens will be required to cover their nose and mouth with a cloth mask, in shops and public transport.
North Rhine-Westphalia's premier Armin Laschet told reporters that they have taken the decision together with federal states Rheinland-Palatinate and Saarland, and these states will coordinate the implementation of the new measures.
Germany's eastern state of Saxony was the first federal state to make wearing masks mandatory, and the regulation which came into effect on Monday, will remain in place until at least on May 3.
Saxony's Social Affairs Minister Petra Koepping urged citizens to cover their nose and mouth with a scarf, bandana or any other clothing if there's no other alternative.
In Germany's capital Berlin, and other largest cities including Hamburg, Frankfurt and Munich, people will be required to wear cloth masks while shopping and in public transport, beginning from next Monday.
The German government announced last week that it managed to bring COVID-19 health emergency under control and partially relaxed strict lockdown measures, allowing small shops to reopen.
But Chancellor Angela Merkel also warned against complacency and urged citizens to closely follow social distancing measures to prevent a new wave of infection.
Germany has the fifth-highest tally of reported COVID-19 infections in the world, ranking behind the US, Spain, Italy, and France.
But its death toll remains far lower than other hard-hit countries.
Besides widespread coronavirus testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, Germany has also significantly raised the bed capacity of intensive care units in hospitals.
As of Wednesday, hospitals across the country had more than 12,600 free intensive care beds for coronavirus patients.
After being first detected in China late last year, the virus has spread to 185 countries and regions.
It has killed nearly 180,000 people and infected almost 2.6 million, while more than 696,900 have recovered, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University.

Despite coronavirus fears, Indonesia's Aceh holds public floggings.
Six people were publicly flogged in Indonesia's conservative Aceh province on Tuesday for breaking local Islamic law, despite widespread bans on mass gatherings over coronavirus fears.
Officials insisted they followed social distancing rules but vowed that the global pandemic wouldn't stand in the way of doling out justice.
Most of the offenders whipped on Tuesday were not wearing protective face masks, and images from the scene suggested some participants came into close contact with each other.
Aceh's public whippings – widely criticised by rights groups – can attract hundreds of spectators.
But only about a dozen onlookers turned up at a building inside a public park to see four men flogged 40 times each for drinking alcohol.
An unmarried couple caught together in a hotel room were also given over two dozen lashes from a rattan cane.
Aceh, on the western tip of Sumatra is the only region in Muslim-majority Indonesia to impose Islamic law.
The province allows whipping for gambling, adultery, drinking alcohol, and having gay or pre-marital sex.
Japan's Nagasaki confirms 33 coronavirus cases on cruise ship docked for repairs.
Japan's Nagasaki prefecture said on Wednesday it had confirmed 33 cases of coronavirus infection on an Italian cruise ship docked for repairs and would carry out further testing on other crew members.
Those who test positive but are asymptomatic will remain on board for monitoring, while others will be transferred to medical institutions, Nagasaki Governor Hodo Nakamura told a news conference.
Those who test negative will be sent back to their countries, he said.
The ship, the Costa Atlantica, is carrying 623 crew members and no passengers, local media reported.
Vietnam's Covid-19 test kits meet European standards.
Vietnam-made Covid-19 test kits have been certified as meeting European standards by the United Kingdom's Department of Health and Social Care, reported the Government news website.
Phan Quoc Viet, general director of Viet A Technologies JSC, said that the UK department has issued a CE certificate and a certificate of free sale for the test kits, which are being manufactured by the firm in collaboration with the Vietnam Military Medical Academy.
Even though the UK left the European Union on January 31, the European Pharmaceutical Law is still being applied by Britain until December 31.
Under EU regulations, if any EU member grants a CE to any product, that product can be sold in Europe.
As such, the Covid-19 test kits manufactured in Vietnam can be sold in all EU member countries, including Britain.
Following the kits' certification by the UK, some partners have registered to buy and exclusively distribute them to Britain, India, Mexico, the United States and some countries in Europe.
Earlier in March, as many as 20 countries made deals to purchase Vietnam's Covid-19 test kits.
In the initial stage, Viet A Company will export the product to Iran, Finland, Malaysia and Ukraine.
Iran has registered to buy 4,000 test kits, while Ukraine has placed an order of 300 test kits.
Viet A Company can turn out 10,000 test kits per day.
It can triple production to meet the demand from the local market and for export or international support.
Vietnam's recovered Covid-19 cases rise to 222.
Six more recovered Covid-19 patients will be discharged from hospital this afternoon, April 22, taking the country's total number of recoveries to 222, accounting for 83% of all people diagnosed with the virus, according to the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
They are the 184th, 125th, 216th, 227th, 246th and 266th cases, who were sent to the Hanoi-based hospital from March 28 to April 14.
Among the six, two had returned to Vietnam from Germany and Russia through Noi Bai International Airport.
The three women and three men are no longer presenting symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, the local media reported.
The six patients, whose test results came back negative twice or three times, will continue to self-isolate for another 14 days at home after being released from the hospital.
Vietnam develops coronavirus contact tracing app.
Bluezone, a Bluetooth-based app that helps determine if a person has come into contact with a Covid-19 patient, has got the Vietnamese government's approval.
The contract tracing app was developed by technology firm Bkav and the Ministry of Information and Communications was briefed about it in mid-April.
The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy, a wireless personal area network technology, to link with smartphones within a two-meter distance.
It will notify its users if they came within two meters of a Covid-19 patient in the past 14 days.
When there is a new case of Covid-19, health authorities will enter the patient's information into a system that will send that data to smartphones installed with Bluezone to track the patient's history in the previous 14 days.
The app alerts users if they are at risk of infection and instructs them to contact health authorities.
The ministry and the Ministry of Health have backed the development of Bluezone and encourage people to use it to protect themselves.
Both believe the app will be effective in controlling an outbreak, especially as people gradually return to normal life soon.
The application will be available on the App Store and Google Play in the next few days.
Now users can download the app at bluezone.vn.
With Vietnam reporting no new Covid-19 cases for five days as of Tuesday, its infection tally has remained at 268.
There have been no deaths in the country and only 53 people are in hospital.
Lam moved to Muangthong in early 2019 from Hai Phong FC for a transfer fee of $300,000 and a salary of $11,000 per month.
His contract expires in November 2021.
Two possible replacements for Lam are Viettel FC's Tran Nguyen Manh and Nguyen Tuan Manh.
The VFF also said it is trying its best to help Vietnamese-Czech keeper Filip Nguyen get Vietnamese citizenship soon so that coach Park Hang-seo has more options.
Lam was in superb form during the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, letting in only one goal in five games and helping Vietnam top the table.
In the 2018 AFF Cup that Vietnam won, he was named in the team of the tournament after conceding only four goals in eight matches.
Six New Coronaviruses Found in Bats in Myanmar.
Scientists from the Smithsonian's Global Health Program take samples from a bumble bee bat in Myanmar.
Researchers have discovered six new coronaviruses in bats while studying how diseases can pass from animals to humans.
The scientists said the coronaviruses – found in bats in Myanmar – are not closely related to the coronavirus now affecting many parts of the world.
The research was led by scientists from the Smithsonian's Global Health Program in Washington, D.C.
The findings were recently reported in a study in the publication PLOS ONE.
The researchers said the six new coronaviruses have never been discovered anywhere in the world.
The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals.
The CDC adds that it is rare for animal coronaviruses to infect people and then spread among the human population.
However, there have been major disease outbreaks caused by coronaviruses in humans.
Bats have been linked to some of them.
The viruses responsible for diseases SARS and MERS were linked to bats.
The CDC says the new coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, also came from bats.
Health experts estimate that thousands of coronaviruses are present in bats, with many still undiscovered.
The Smithsonian team worked with researchers in Myanmar on a project aimed at identifying new diseases that are zoonotic –meaning they can spread from animals to humans.
The project, called PREDICT, is supported by the U.S Agency for International Development (USAID).
Researchers working on the project say zoonotic diseases represent about 75 percent of new diseases affecting humans.
One of their goals is to study how contact between humans and wildlife can lead to coronavirus infections in people.
Health officials inspect bats to be confiscated and culled in the wake of coronavirus outbreak at a live animal market in Solo, Central Java, Indonesia, Saturday, March 14, 2020.
The team centered its research in areas where humans were most likely to come into close contact with local wildlife.
Among the team members were representatives from Myanmar government agencies.
The researchers collected 759 samples of saliva and waste from bats in the areas from May 2016 to August 2018.
After examining the samples, they identified the six new kinds of coronavirus.
The team also discovered a coronavirus found in other parts of Southeast Asia, but never before in Myanmar.
Marc Valitutto is a former wildlife veterinarian with the Smithsonian's Global Health Program.
He was the lead writer of the study.
He said in a statement that widespread disease outbreaks like COVID-19 should remind us how closely human health is connected to the health of wildlife and the environment.
The goal is to prevent the virus from getting into humans in the first place, Valitutto told Smithsonian Magazine.
He added that future research will seek to learn more about how coronaviruses behave in animals.
For example, what permits the viruses to mutate and spread to other species.
Such research can help reduce the possibility of future pandemics, Valitutto said.
Suzan Murray is the director of the Smithsonian's Global Health Program.
She said many coronaviruses do not present risks to humans.
However, she noted identifying them early on in animals can be an effective way to investigate possible disease threats.
Vigilant surveillance, research and education are the best tools we have to prevent pandemics before they occur, Murray said.
Donald Trump says he will suspend all immigration to the US to fight coronavirus.
Donald Trump has announced that he will sign a temporary order to ban all immigration to the United States to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
The US president revealed the move on Twitter, claiming that he will use the executive power of the presidency to close America's borders.
In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!
The US president offered no details as to what immigration policies might be affected by the order.
Due to the pandemic, almost all visa processing by the State Department, including immigrant visas, has been suspended for weeks.
More than 750,000 Americans have been infected with Covid-19 and more than 42,000 have died.
The move effectively achieves one of Mr Trump's long-term policy goals of curbing immigration, making use of the health and economic crisis that has swept the country as a result of the pandemic to do so.
The decision drew swift condemnation from Democrats.
Vietnam enters fifth straight day with no new Covid-19 cases.
Vietnam reported no new infection Tuesday morning, keeping the nation's Covid-19 tally unchanged for the fifth day in a row.
The national infection total has stayed at 268 since last Thursday morning, and 215 have been discharged from hospitals, including 12 on Monday.
The extended social distancing campaign in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and ten other localities, Lao Cai, Quang Ninh, Bac Ninh, Ninh Binh in the north.

American scientists are evaluating the impact of BCG.
If it proves effective, it will be tested on 4,000 health workers.
In the Netherlands, 400 frontline doctors have been vaccinated for the experiment.
A similar study has begun in Australia.
However, there have been cases of the vaccine causing complications in adults.
Nhung warned that people should not inject the vaccine at home.
If you rely on vaccines but do not strictly implement preventive measures recommended by the Ministry of Health including wearing masks, regularly disinfecting hands, social distancing ..
then there will be outbreaks with devastating outcomes.
Of Vietnam's total of 268 Covid-19 cases, 215 have been discharged.
The country has gone five days now without a new infection.
Vietnam protests China's establishment of Sansha City.
Vietnam has strongly protested China's establishment of Sansha City and related illegal acts that seriously violate Vietnam's sovereignty, Le Thi Thu Hang, spokesperson of Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, said on April 19.
On April 18, China announced through China Global Television Network the establishment of the Xisha District on Vietnam's Hoang Sa (Paracel) Archipelago and Nansha District on Vietnam's Truong Sa (Spratly) Archipelago.
The two districts will reportedly be under the jurisdiction of Sansha City.
According to China Global Television Network, Sansha City will have a population of 1,800.
The headquarters of Xisha District will be located on Phu Lam Island of Hoang Sa Archipelago, while Nansha District will be headquartered on the Chu Thap reef of Truong Sa Archipelago.
Hang stated that Vietnam has repeatedly presented sufficient historical evidence and a legal foundation to assert its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa archipelagos.
China's establishment of the so-called Sansha City and related acts are invalid and unrecognized, and they are detrimental to the friendship between countries and will further complicate the situation in the East Sea, the region and the world, Hang remarked.
The real estate consultancy said in a recent statement that multinational manufacturers have been setting up operations in Vietnam for a number of years and this trend is poised to strengthened.
This movement has accelerated over the past 12-24 months, with companies looking to diversify their operations and supply chains due to tariffs on goods exported from China to the United States.
Stephen Wyatt, Country Head at JLL Vietnam, noted that Vietnam remains a promising market, with a growing trend during the past few years of manufacturing companies looking to set up operations in the country.
Industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and, therefore, land prices are expected to increase, in line with the long-term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, Wyatt said.
Companies looking to diversify their manufacturing portfolios outside China are attracted to Vietnam, thanks to its proximity to China, free trade agreements and the Government's plans to develop Vietnam into a manufacturing hub for Southeast Asia, according to JLL's latest market report.
Also, the report noted that the average price of land in northern Vietnam reached US$99 per square meter per lease term, up 6.5% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020.
Meanwhile, the figure for the southern region was US$101, a year-on-year increase of 12.2%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019.
In addition, ready-built factories recorded an average price of US$3.5-5 per square meter per month in both regions.

Facebook ads creator omits East Sea islands in Vietnam's map.
In 2018, Facebook wrongly displayed the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos as part of China in its ad creation section.
It fixed the error later, saying it was a technical issue.
Vietnam's Spratly and Paracel Islands are not displayed on the nation's map in a Facebook function that helps users create their own ads.
As of Wednesday night, several users said they could not find the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos when they chose Vietnam as the target region in an ad creating function on Facebook.
But when the target region was China, the islands showed up.
Facebook has said that the islands' disappearance from Vietnam's map was caused by an error when the map was updated, said Le Quang Tu Do, deputy director general of the Authority of Broadcasting, Television and Electronic Information under the Ministry of Information and Communications.
A Facebook representative said Thursday afternoon that the error has been fixed.
We are sorry for any confusion caused, the spokesperson said.
The islands now cannot be found when users choose either Vietnam or China as the target region.
Facebook maintains neutral standpoint in disputed areas or other sensitive geographical zones, the representative said.
The map section used for Facebook's ad creation function is sourced from OpenStreetMap, an open-data, editable map project based in the U.K.
The Facebook representative in Vietnam is yet to comment on the matter.
Previously, in 2018, Facebook had also wrongly displayed the archipelagos as part of China in its ad creation section.
It fixed the error later, saying it was a technical issue.
Vietnam has consistently affirmed that it has full legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly Islands.
China seized the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam by force in 1974, and has been illegally occupying a number of reefs in the Spratly Islands since 1988.

According to Bamboo Airways, some Facebook users have shared information from an unverified website stating that the airline had sold the stake to Chinese investors that may help China manipulate Vietnam's airspace.
In response, the carrier confirmed that it has no Chinese investors and none of its shareholders have received funding from Chinese investors.
The legal department at Bamboo Airways has submitted evidence supporting its position to the competent agencies to help the carrier address the fake news.
Also, the website has been identified on Vietnam's mainstream media platforms as a source of fake and anti-State news, noted the carrier.
Earlier, FLC Group in its 2019 financial report stated that its current ownership in Bamboo Airways is now 52.1%, down from 100%.
However, both FLC and Bamboo Airways have yet to release official information on the investors who purchased the 47.9% stake in the carrier.
American man faces deportation for falsely claiming Covid-19 infection.
An American in northern port city of Hai Phong faces deportation after falsely claiming he was Covid-19 positive, authorities said Wednesday.
Au Joseph Elhayboubi, 32, had entered Vietnam last October, and his visa allowed him to stay until January 25.
Previously, since May 2018, he had tried several times to enter Vietnam for traveling and working in foreign language centers, but failed.
After entering Vietnam, he traveled to several localities and applied for jobs.
He came to Hai Phong in January and applied for a job at a local English center, but failed.
He left and visited several other places before returning to the northern city on March 22.
He then reported to authorities that he had Covid-19.
He was taken to the Viet Tiep Hospital to be monitored.
Elhayboubi later tested negative for the novel coronavirus.
Police said it was likely that he did not have enough money and couldn't return to the U.S.
as international flights in Vietnam are currently suspended under Covid-19 prevention policies.
He came up with the Covid-19 ploy so he would be provided accommodation and food in Vietnam, they said.
Elhayboubi finished his quarantine period on April 3.
For that, I propose that the government should work on a strategy of gradually tightening restrictions and firming up regulations so that we can finally achieve victory.
He said the city has the epidemic under control with no new cases in the last eight days and only five in the last 15, 88 percent less than in the previous 15 days.
This was thanks to the social distancing campaign between April 1 and 15, the early response by the city as well as its drastic moves to infected areas and public awareness of the need to follow the rules, he said.
But the disease remains unpredictable, he said.
Phong warned, if we loosen the rules, we could lose the battle.
So far city officials have fined over 5,000 people VND100,000-300,000 ($4.26-12.78) for not wearing a face masks in public.

Footwear maker Pouyuen Vietnam was ordered to halt operations for two days starting Tuesday due to Covid-19 safety concerns.
The order came after HCMC health authorities inspected the Taiwan-invested company on Saturday and found some employees without masks and a large number ignoring social distancing rules.
The city had on April 6 inspected Pouyuen's premises and found the novel coronavirus infection risk indicator to be 81 percent, while municipal regulations stipulate companies with an indicator over 80 percent must be closed temporarily.

Vietnam cuts electricity price to ease Covid-19 burden.
The proposal by the Ministry of Industry and Trade aims to support citizens and businesses amid the Covid-19 epidemic.
The ministry, however, would be gathering opinions from other ministries and sectors.
Under the current proposal, a 10 percent reduction would be applied to electricity prices for households at tiers 1-4 (electricity consumption below 300 kWh).
Businesses would also receive a 10 percent discount during peak, normal and off-peak hours, while tourist accommodation would be entitled to the same electricity prices as households and production firms.
Establishments used for the concentrated quarantine or treatment of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients would be exempted from paying electricity bills, while those that provide medical examinations, testing and treatment for confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases would receive a 20 percent discount in electricity prices.
Hotels and tourist accommodation that has been used to quarantine confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients would also be entitled to a 20 percent price downgrade.
Electricity price reductions would be applied to bills for electricity consumption in April, May, and June, or bills received in May, June, and July.
According to calculations, the total value of this support package for electricity consumers would be nearly VND11 trillion ($470 million), of which the amount in electricity bills saved would be VND6.1 trillion ($262.93 million) for businesses, VND2.9 trillion ($125 million) for households, VND1.8 trillion ($77.59 million) for tourist accommodation and VND100 billion ($4.3 million) for establishments taking part in the fight against Covid-19.
Vietnam has two more cases of Covid-19.
Two residents of Ha Loi Hamlet in Hanoi City's Me Linh District, the country's newest coronavirus infection cluster, have tested positive for the virus, raising the nation's total number of confirmed cases to 262 this morning, April 13.

On March 27, the patient had close contact with the 254th case, who is his uncle.
He developed symptoms of cough and fever on March 31 and tested positive for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, on April 12.
The country had reported 10 cases of Covid-19 linked to Ha Loi Hamlet as of this morning, April 13.

Vietnam schools set to reopen in June after four-month break.
Students can return to school by June 15 at the latest if the Covid-19 epidemic remains under control, the Ministry of Education and Training said Friday.
Nguyen Huu Do, Deputy Minister of Education and Training, said at a Friday meeting that teachers will help students review lessons after they have studied online at home during the coronavirus-induced closures and complete the second semester and final examinations from June 15 to July 15.
Vietnam's school year starts in August or September with two semesters and a normal semester lasts four months.
Grade 12 students will have three weeks to review their lessons before the national high school examination which will take place from August 8-11, Do said.
The graduation exam has been pushed back two months from previous years with schools remaining closed for a long time.
Vietnam's national high school graduation exam is considered to be a make-or-break event for the students, determining if they can enter a good university or not.
If schools remain closed even on June 15, the ministry will report the situation to the National Assembly to reconsider rescheduling the national high school examination.
He also said the ministry has devised many measures to help students study online and via televised lessons.
It has also held conferences with teachers in localities to guide them on online teaching.
In mountainous areas like the northern province of Ha Giang, students do not have the opportunity to study online so teachers teach them in small groups so that their learning is not interrupted, he said.
22 million students in Vietnam had completed the 20th week of school in the new academic year before they began a fortnight-long Lunar New Year holiday that started January 17.
40 provinces and cities have extended school breaks until further notice, while schools in the remaining 23 localities have said school closures will last until mid-April.
HCMC authorities said Friday that the city's 1.7 million students can return to school mid-May, a month earlier than proposed by the education ministry for the entire country.
The rationale offered for the early reopening was that the city was handling the Covid-19 spread well and has only used 3.5 percent of its total number of hospital beds.
Quarantine barriers at Bạch Mai Hospital removed.
When Bạch Mai Hospital in Hà Nội was identified as a COVID-19 hotspot, the authorities acted swiftly.

Hanoi to jail those spreading fake news on Covid-19.
Hanoi police will launch criminal investigations that could lead to jail terms of up to seven years for those posting false Covid-19 information.
The police department in the capital city said many people have made use of the complicated development of the Covid-19 pandemic to spread false information on social media to generate likes, views, and shares.
This has sowed confusion among people and made it more difficult to take preventive action against the novel coronavirus, the department said.
To tighten control over the propagation of fake news, Hanoi police will launch criminal investigations into suspects.
Anyone posting fraudulent information on the Covid-19 disease causing negative impacts on the public's response will be investigated for illegally posting or using information on computer networks and telecommunication networks, an offense that carries a maximum prison term of seven years.
In case anyone spreads personal and private information or insults the dignity and honor of health workers on the frontline of the epidemic fight, as well as of patients and suspects, they will be investigated for insulting others and face a jail term of up to five years.
Police and other Hanoi authorities have called on residents to be more discerning about the information they receive, and follow official sources on the epidemic in Vietnam.
Ever since the Covid-19 broke out in Vietnam, police in Hanoi have handled more than 70 cases of spreading fake news.
Other localities have reported hundreds of such cases, too.
Not a single person has faced criminal charges so far, though many have been fined VND10-15 million ($427- 641).
Last month, Vietnam's Supreme People's Court asked all civil and military courts across the country to apply Article 240 in the 2015 Penal Code against those escaping quarantine and making false health declarations in the context of the country entering a critical stage in its Covid-19 fight.
Those making fraudulent medical declarations when returning to Vietnam from Covid-19 stricken areas can be jailed for up to five years.
Vietnam lifts rice export ban.
Vietnam has lifted its ban on rice exports with immediate effect, allowing 400,000 tonnes to be shipped this month.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc scrapped the ban Friday and ordered relevant ministries to develop an export plan what will ensure the benefits of farmers and traders.

Northern Irish driver pleads guilty over 39 Vietnamese truck deaths.
Maurice Robinson has pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter related to the deaths of Vietnamese people found in a shipping container in southeast England last year, police said Wednesday.
The victims, 31 men and boys and eight women whose ages ranged from 15 to 44, were discovered in October in a container at the back of a truck driven by Robinson to an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London.
Most were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh Provinces in north-central Vietnam.
Robinson, 25, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing in November to charges of conspiring to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring cash which he knew or suspected came from criminal conduct.
At Wednesday's hearing at the Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, a second man who was also charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, British-Romanian dual national Gheorghe Nica, 43, pleaded not guilty.
Several others have been arrested and charged in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom.
Autopsies concluded that the provisional cause of death of the 39 Vietnamese people was a combination of hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, and hyperthermia, or overheating, in an enclosed space.
The trial will begin on Monday, October 5.
Vietnam donates half a million face masks to five European countries.
Vietnam has handed over 550,000 antibacterial cloth masks to France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K to support their Covid-19 fight.
A ceremony to mark the donation was held Tuesday wherein Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister To Anh Dung symbolically handed over the made-in-Vietnam masks to the ambassadors of the five nations.
A Foreign Ministry statement said that in the spirit of strategic partnership and traditional friendship, Vietnam has devoted part of its resources to helping European countries, so that they can have more means to protect people's health and overcome the current difficult period, when the Covid-19 pandemic has been having very serious impacts on the continent.
Europe has emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic alongside the U.S, with Italy leading the world in the number of deaths at over 17,000, followed by Spain with more than 14,000.
The U.S is third with more than 12,800 deaths, followed by France with more than 10,300, U.K more than 6,000 and Germany more than 2,000.
Dung said in this global health crisis, no single country can effectively deal with the spread of the disease, and international cooperation and strengthened solidarity are important factors in protecting the health and ensuring safety of the people.
All nations are beholden to contribute to minimizing the enormous impacts of Covid-19, he said.
He said, Vietnam is always ready to cooperate closely, exchange experiences, and join hands with other countries to implement necessary measures in accordance with bilateral and multilateral frameworks such as the ASEAN - EU, the G20, and the United Nations with a strong determination to soon repel and control the pandemic.

Vietnam rejects China's sovereignty claims over Vietnamese territories.
Vietnam has rejected and protested China sending two diplomatic notes to the U.N., laying claim to Vietnamese territories in the East Sea.
One of the diplomatic notes was sent by China to the United Nations (U.N.) on March 23 in response to the Philippines.
It claimed illegally that China has sovereignty over the Spratly Islands and adjacent waters, has sovereignty and jurisdiction rights over relevant sea areas, seabeds and subsoil.
It also said that it has historic rights in the East Sea, internationally known as the South China Sea, based on historical and legal evidences.
The other note was sent on December 12 last year in response to Malaysia.
It also made the illegal claim that China has sovereignty over islands in the East Sea, including the Pratas, Spratly and Paracel Islands and the Zhongsa Qundao.
What China calls the Zhongsa Qundao are the Macclesfield Bank and the Scarborough Shoal.
China also mentioned its historical rights in the East Sea.
A diplomatic note sent by Vietnam's Permanent Mission to the U.N on March 30 said.
Vietnam protests China's claims in the aforementioned diplomatic notes.
These claims seriously violate Vietnam's sovereignty and jurisdiction rights over the East Sea.
Vietnam has full legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel Islands in accordance with international law, the note stressed.
Vietnam considers the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to be the sole legal basis that comprehensively and absolutely dictates the scope of rights over sea areas between Vietnam and China.
Vietnam's consistent stance on the aforementioned issues has been affirmed multiple times in several documents issued at the U.N., as well as in statements sent to relevant international entities.
Vietnam requests that the U.N Secretary-General issues its diplomatic note to all member nations of UNCLOS as well as members of the U.N., the note said.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including waters close to Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Taiwan.

Online searches for condoms rose 56 percent in March.
Online searches for condoms rose 56 percent in March as people stayed at home, fearful of the coronavirus pandemic.
The rise was recorded on iPrice, a website aggregator of online products for customers to compare prices, which suggested it was because of limited traveling in the country.

US 'seriously concerned' over China sinking Vietnamese fishing boat.
US State Department spokesman Morgan Ortagus Monday condemned China for sinking a Vietnamese fishing boat, calling it an assertion of an unlawful claim.
Ortagus said the US was seriously concerned on the incident that took place near the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea.
He said the incident was another act by China to assert unlawful maritime claims and disadvantage its Southeast Asian neighbors in the South China Sea.
On Thursday, a Chinese coast guard vessel rammed and sank the boat owned by Tran Hong Tho, a native of the central province of Quang Ngai, with eight fishermen onboard as they were fishing off the Phu Lam (Woody) Island in Vietnam's Hoang Sa Archipelago (Paracel Islands).
Vietnam calls the South China Sea the East Sea.
The U.S State Department spokesman also noted that Beijing has rolled out new research stations on military bases it has built on Fiery Cross Reef and Subi Reef, and landed special military aircraft on the Fiery Cross Reef since the onset of the global pandemic.
Maritime militia has also continued to be deployed by China around the Spratly Islands, Ortagus said, adding that China's infamous nine-dashed line had been deemed an unlawful maritime claim by an arbitral tribunal convened under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention in July 2016, a position shared by the U.S Government.
Ortagus called on Beijing to remain focused on working on the Covid-19 pandemic with the international community and to cease its exploitation of the distraction or vulnerability of other countries to expand its claims in the South China Sea.
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman Le Thi Thu Hang had demanded Friday that China investigates the incident and  take strict action against the Chinese vessel and refrain from repeating such acts in future as well as pay proper compensation for the damage caused to the Vietnamese fishermen.
These actions of the Chinese vessel have infringed on Vietnam's sovereignty over the Hoang Sa Islands and endangered the lives and properties of Vietnamese fishermen, she said.
China's actions also go against the common view of senior leaders of the two countries on treating fishermen humanely.
as well as the Vietnam-China Agreement on Basic Principles Guiding the Settlement of Maritime Issues.
They also violate the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and negatively affect negotiations for a Code of Conduct in the waters, Hang said.
The move has increased tensions, caused destabilization and is not beneficial to the maintenance of peace, stability, and cooperation in the region, she added.
Hang had reiterated that Vietnam has full legal basis and historical evidence under international law to assert its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) archipelagos.
The Vietnam Fisheries Society has also called on the Government Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other government agencies to ensure China pays compensation to Vietnamese fishermen for sinking their boats.
The Quang Ngai's Fisheries Society said that after sinking the Vietnamese boat, the Chinese vessel had picked up eight Vietnamese fishermen and taken them to the Woody Island.
Upon receiving news of the sunken ship, three other Vietnamese fishing boats tried to rescue then, but were chased away by the Chinese vessel.
Two of the vessels were captured and towed to the island.
At 2 p.m Thursday, China released the two fishing boats and eight fishermen.
A day later, Vietnamese authorities received the detained Vietnamese fishermen safely.
China seized the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam by force in 1974, and has since been occupying them illegally.
In 2014 China brought an oil rig, Haiyang Shiyou 981, and installed it in waters off the Paracel Islands, changing the status quo in the waters.
Since then, Chinese ships have chased after and rammed many Vietnamese fishing vessels near the islands in Vietnamese waters.

Tran Dac Phu, senior advisor at the Public Health Emergency Operations Center under the Health Ministry, said at a meeting Monday that the improvement seen was not a reason for Vietnam and its citizens to neglect any measure needed to prevent the spread of the infection.
We cannot say anything at this point about the decrease in the number of new cases because the incubation time has been identified at 14 days, he said, adding that as the number of cases are falling, stronger measures should be taken.
If we're not careful, Vietnam can see the epidemic grow out of control, just like it has happened in many other places in the world right now, he said.

We are also preparing for the worst-case scenarios, Cuong remarked.
The deputy minister noted that Vietnam has strictly applied coronavirus infection prevention and control measures, and the pandemic is still under control.
However, it is developing unpredictably so the Government and all citizens should not be careless.
Deputy Minister of Public Security Nguyen Van Son pointed out that the number of new infections has dropped in recent days.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the move could come as early as Tuesday.
He also announced a huge stimulus plan to help the economy weather the virus.

Health officials recommend frequent hand washing for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water or use alcohol-based sanitizer.
The Associated Press cites the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals.
Many viewers praised the lyrics of the song 'Drum rice - against Covid-19'.
The Rice Drum is a cheerful folk song from the Red River Delta region that is known and loved by Vietnamese across different generations.

Patient zero of some Covid-19 flash points remains unidentified.
Several new flashpoints in the spread of the coronavirus in Vietnam cannot identify patient zero, the first case to be infected with the virus and spread it to others.
This poses a high risk of cross-infection in the community and requires stricter social distancing measures, according to Associate Professor Dr Tran Dac Phu, senior advisor at the Center for Emergency Response to Public Health Events of Vietnam.
Patients zero of previous Covid-19 flashpoints have been found.
The 17th case was identified as the patient zero of the flashpoint on Truc Bach Street, Hanoi, while the 34th case was identified as the first infection in Binh Thuan Province.

Buddha Bar in HCMC and Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi.
Dr Phu stated that Vietnam's method of fighting coronavirus is early identification, early diagnosis and early isolation.
This is what China has effectively done and South Korea is following.
According to Phu, this is a crucial time for combating the coronavirus, requiring stricter social distancing measures.
Compared with some other countries, Vietnam is doing very well in controlling the pandemic by taking prompt and effective measures.
He said, if we strictly comply with coronavirus infection prevention and control measures, we will definitely fight off Covid-19 soon.
Nationwide social distancing, not lockdown.
The prime minister's order on nationwide social distancing for 15 days, starting on April 1, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus does not mean an all-out ban on travel and trade, stated Minister and Chairman of the Government Office Mai Tien Dung.
According to Dung, some local authorities have misunderstood and improperly applied the prime minister's directive.
Nationwide social distancing is not a lockdown, but since April 1, some authorities have built barriers to prevent people from traveling or have suspended construction.
The Government Office has discussed the situation with these local authorities and will send them detailed guidance to help them apply the prime minister's directive.
Dung stressed that the Government has not banned travel but is encouraging people to stay at home as much as possible and only go out if necessary.
The minister spoke highly of the Hanoi government's efforts in monitoring immigration at its gateways by checking the body temperature and health of travelers.
The Government is still allowing factories or companies that produce essential goods to continue operating, but their employees are required to wear face masks and practice social distancing.
If a coronavirus case is reported, these factories and companies must shut down immediately to prevent cross infection.
Civil servants and employees of other businesses have been encouraged to work from home.
Explaining why the Government has not issued a national lockdown, the minister noted that the pandemic is still under control and there are many provinces that have not reported coronavirus infections.
It is not necessary to suspend the production of essential goods and transport at the moment and socioeconomic stability must be ensured.
Depending on how the pandemic develops, the Government will issue further notices and regulations.
Upcoming plans for Vietnam football team after pandemic break.
The Covid-19 pandemic has understandably changed this year's schedule for the Vietnamese football team, who have to prepare for two major events this year.
They had been supposed to gather for training on March 21 before FIFA announced the postponement of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, which included a clash against Malaysia on March 31.
The team had to adjust their plans, including canceling a friendly against Kyrgyzstan on March 26.
In the last three months of the year Vietnam have two important engagements, the rescheduled World Cup qualifiers on October 13 and November 12 and 17 against Malaysia, Indonesia and the UAE and the AFF Cup from November 23 to December 31.
National coach Park Hang-seo thus has nearly seven months to prepare for the 11 matches.
His main mission now is to find players from the domestic league.
But with the V.League 1 postponed after two rounds because of the coronavirus, the Korean and his assistants cannot do anything at the moment but wait for its resumption.
If it resumes as tentatively schedule on April 15, they will have a busy time since they will have to watch eight rounds of matches in just 44 days (the first leg concludes on May 29) plus a few more matches in the V.League 2.
According to the Vietnam Football Federation, if the Covid-19 situation is controlled and normalcy returns, the national team can gather for training on May 28 or June 1.
People might wonder why in June since the matches only begin in October.
The short answer is that the VFF and Park have agreed to stick to the training schedule.
The second gathering of the national team will be in mid-September after the V.League 1 concludes.
This time the team are expected to go through intense preparations to try and qualify for the World Cup and defend the AFF Cup title they won last year.
Vietnam are leading group G of the qualifiers with 11 points after five unbeaten games.
They will advance to the final round if they can get seven points from the remaining three matches.

She takes the number of patients linked to the Bach Mai Hospital to 43, 27 of whom are employees of the Truong Sinh Company.
The other five patients are people quarantined on arrival from abroad.

Trump again defends use of the term 'China virus'.
President Donald Trump was pressed for the second straight day on why he is calling the coronavirus the Chinese virus, amid instances of bigotry against Asian Americans.
After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing.
Trump claimed that he is using the term because China tried to blame the virus on US soldiers.
Cause it comes from China.
It's not racist at all, no, not at all.
It comes from China, that's why.
I want to be accurate, Trump said on Wednesday.
Pressed again, he said.
I have great love for all of the people from our country, but as you know China tried to say at one point ..
that it was caused by American soldiers.
That can't happen.
It's not gonna happen, not as long as I'm President.
It comes from China.
He also denied that it was a racist term to use.
Nationwide social distancing to be extended to end of month.
Nationwide social distancing shall be extended until the end of April to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said at a meeting of the Government yesterday, April 1.
The prime minister earlier issued an order on nationwide social distancing for 15 days, starting at midnight on April 1 as an emergency measure to handle the virus.
Phuc cited a survey by the Berlin-based Dalia Research, noting that the Vietnamese people's confidence in the Government's response to Covid-19 is the highest in the world, with 62% of respondents in Vietnam.
He stressed that the Government will take stronger measures in the coming days to fight off the pandemic.
If necessary, nationwide social distancing will be extended from the current 15 days to one month.
According to Phuc, nationwide social distancing does not mean banning transport, restricting the production and trade of necessities and essential services or suspending construction.
It calls on the public to stay at home and only go out if necessary for buying food and medicine or working in factories or production facilities that produce essential goods and other emergency cases.
Besides this, people should maintain a safe physical distance of at least 2 meters and not gather in groups of more than two in public places.
Factories and production facilities should be disinfected regularly, while employees are required to wear face masks and practice social distancing.
Though many countries have posted negative growth due to the coronavirus, Phuc stated that Vietnam's gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.82% in the first quarter of 2020 was not too bad.
The Government will try its best to prevent an economic downturn, he stressed.
However, the safety of the people will be prioritized ahead of economic growth.
If the pandemic continues, protecting the people's health will be the most important thing, not production or economic growth, Phuc said.
Vietnam is applying three policies to ensure socioeconomic stability.
an easy monetary policy that reduces interest rates with a package worth VND250 trillion.
fiscal stimulus through tax reductions or tax payment extensions with a stimulus package worth VND30 trillion.
and aid for unemployed, poor or disadvantaged people.
Phuc noted that these packages should be even larger to support socio-economic stability.
EU nations split on the economic rescue plan owning to the effect of COVID-19.
In a meeting on March 24, it was the European Union (EU) Finance Ministers that failed to reach an agreement on essential measures to withstand the economic shock due to the acute respiratory disease, called COVID-19, and nations' leaders will put this problem on the table one more time at the Online Summit on March 26.
As a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, the European economy has been brought to its knees, and Italy - with the backing of France and Spain, has great expectation of a massive response from EU partners in a historic act of financial solidarity.
Nevertheless, northern countries, especially Germany and the Netherlands, hardly think that it is an urgent matter for the reason that they believe that a huge stimulus announced by the European Central Bank is sufficient for now.
After two hours of talks without reaching a consensus, it was Mario Centeno, the president of the group of EU finance ministers (Eurogroup) that issued a declaration that the Finance Ministers made commitments to exploring all possible avenues to support the group's economies to make it through this hard time.
As such, the city had earlier asked the Ministry of Home Affairs to issue instructions on the establishment of a satellite city east of HCMC.
In response to the city's request, the ministry asked HCMC authorities to seek approval and guidance from the Ministry of Construction.

Two men employed, dressed up as the pocong, to guard the village's main entrance for a self-imposed isolation.
IstimewaThe Tuk Songo village in the Purworejo regency of Central Java has recently gone viral on social media for employing two men who dressed up as pocong to guard the village's main entrance, after a self-imposed isolation to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus was put in place.
A pocong is basically the Indonesian zombie, wrapped up from head to toe with white cloth as is customary in Islamic burial rites, with only their faces uncovered.
With the ongoing isolation, all other access to the village is closed and residents can only enter through the pocong-guarded gate.
According to Angko, the village's spokesman, Angko Setiyarso Widodo there is an important subtext behind the pocong guards.
The pocongs are to remind us of death, so anyone who's ngeyel (stubborn) and doesn't wantto participate in the coronavirus preventative measures can themselves become a pocong.
Our hope is for the pandemic to end soon, Angko said.
Vietnam to compensate Covid-19 job loss with monthly allowance.
A government proposal would allow people whose employment is adversely affected by the Covid-19 crisis to receive a monthly allowance of VND1.8 million ($77).
The proposal would cover contract employees, part-time workers and those on unpaid leave or have reduced income as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic's impacts on the country.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc made the proposal at a government meeting Tuesday.
Phuc also requested that businesses ensure they have enough funds to pay their affected employees.
Those without enough funds would be allowed to borrow from the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP) at preferential interest rates, and the State Bank of Vietnam would be required to supply the VBSP with more funds.
Also under the proposal, the poor would receive a monthly allowance of VND1 million ($43), while social protection beneficiaries and those with meritorious services would receive VND500,000 per month.
Household businesses that have had to suspend operation and suffer difficulties due to Covid-19 would also be supported with VND1 million per month.
The allowances would be provided over at least three months (until June), and would be taken from the central government and local administrations' budgets, with the total estimated at VND28-30 trillion ($1.2- 1.3 billion).
Phuc said that the current emergency situation requires the government to ensure basic living standards for the people, especially for laborers, the poor, the weak, part-time workers and those who have lost their jobs, as Covid-19 has heavily impacted on not only production, businesses, and state budget revenue but also the people's lives.
Besides, the Government leader also demanded that various scenarios be mapped out so the country can actively and timely respond to new developments of the deadly virus, with an aim to ensure all people remain safe and sound.
Further, when the nationwide stay-at-home order comes into effect, social security is an urgent issue needed to be resolved since the lives of underprivileged and unemployed people will be hit hardest.
PM Phuc added that this issue will be discussed at another Government meeting, scheduled for tomorrow morning.

Doctors and nurses treating Covid-19 patients in Ho Chi Minh City can rest in hotels and enjoy dining services there.
The city is planning to use three hotels to provide accommodation and dining for doctors and nurses working at three hospitals that are treating Covid-19 patients and quarantining those suspected to have the disease, the municipal health department said Monday.
Several hotel operators have registered to offer their services for quarantining purposes.
For now, the city is treating Covid-19 patients and quarantining suspects at the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases and two of its field hospitals in the two outlying districts of Cu Chi and Can Gio.
The municipal Health Department is mobilizing more doctors and nurses so that they can take turns to be on duty at the three field hospitals.
As of Tuesday morning, the city had recorded 46 cases, of whom 10 have been discharged.
The rest are in stable condition.
In all, Vietnam has confirmed 204 Covid-19 infections, of whom 55 have recovered and been discharged.

Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam has ordered mobilization of all forces to eliminate the novel coronavirus at Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital, one of Vietnam's largest.
Dam said told at an online meeting Saturday that this was a very important task in the coming days and called for all forces of the Ministry of Health, the Hanoi municipality and the Bach Mai Hospital to carry out the mission.
The elimination of Covid-19 outbreaks is crucial when it has spread to the community.
Dam asked for a list to be made of all people who'd been to the hospital since March 12.
All localities whose residents had been to the hospital must take stronger measures and cooperate with relevant agencies to stamp out the Covid-19 outbreak completely, he said.
Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Truong Son said Bach Mai Hospital was a big, dangerous outbreak.
He said the ministry has set up a special task force to carry out epidemiological investigations.
Hanoi Chairman Nguyen Duc Chung had said at a meeting Wednesday that the Bach Mai Hospital was at high risk of becoming a new Covid-19 outbreak center like the Daegu Hospital in South Korea, given common factors like heavy patients and large crowds.
The hospital has suspended admission of new patients and been isolated since Saturday morning.
Nearly 5,000 staff and patients at Bach Mai had been ordered to take Covid-19 tests by this Sunday.
Son said that the hospital is a large medical facility that sees 10,000-15,000 passers-by every day, so the infection can spread not only from patients and medical workers but also from visitors.
Therefore, the risk of infection in Bach Mai, as well as other hospitals, is enormous, he noted.
Officers and medical staff quarantined at the Bach Mai Hospital continue to treat patients still stuck inside.
The Health Ministry will provide medicines, equipment, and other medical supplies and to ensure that the staff can provide complete treatment for patients, Son added.
Associate Professor Tran Dac Phu, former director of the Health Ministry's Preventive Medicine Department, said that over the past two weeks, epidemiologists have been closely monitoring and analyzing day and night to find out the infection route at the Bach Mai Hospital.
On Saturday night, the Vietnamese Army's Chemical Division disinfected the entire area of Bach Mai Hospital.

Hanoi hospital lacks food, necessities for 3,500 inmates.
Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital, locked down Saturday as a major Covid-19 outbreak area, doesn't have enough food and necessities for around 3,500 people.
This includes 800 patients who could neither be discharged nor transferred anywhere else.
About 552 of them are patients with kidney failures who require hemodialysis.
About 100 others are patients' relatives staying behind to take care of their loved ones, while most family members have been transferred to a quarantine zone in the Hoa Lac area, said Nguyen Quang Tuan, director of the Bach Mai Hospital.
The 3,500 people trapped inside, including doctors, nurses and other staff, cannot go outside to purchase even the most basic things like toothbrushes and toothpaste.
The hospital has had to provide such necessities for them, said Tuan.
Bach Mai's cafeteria has been identified as a major source of Covid-19 infection, it has been closed and all its employees quarantined.
This happened after several employees of the Truong Sinh Company, which supplies food and water to the hospital, were found infected.
The lack of nurses and doctors to treat patients has also been a challenge, as over 200 doctors and nurses of Bach Mai have had to be quarantined, many in their own homes, after having had close contact with Covid-19 patients.
The Bach Mai Hospital, in Dong Da District, has been identified as a major Covid-19 outbreak area in Hanoi.
At least 25 confirmed cases were found to be associated with the hospital.

The total confirmed cases of Covid-19, which is associated with the novel coronavirus, in Bach Mai Hospital has reached 25, with 16 working at the hospital's cafeteria.
The hospital has been put on lockdown.
The ministry also made a correction to its announcement issued yesterday evening, stating that the information for the country's 173rd case coincided with that of the 184th case.
According to the correction, the 184th case is a 42-year-old woman working at the Truong Sinh firm.
She is the housemate of two other Truong Sinh employees who tested positive for the coronavirus.

HCMC to fine those without masks in public places.
HCMC, the country's most populous city, plans to fine individuals who do not wear face masks in public places due to heightened concerns over the acceleration of the coronavirus' spread, said city leaders at a meeting on Thursday.
HCMC Party Committee Secretary Nguyen Thien Nhan said the city government is determined not to let foreign nationals increase imported cases.
Also, Vietnamese people who return home from abroad are subject to a mandatory 14-day quarantine period.
Limiting travel and forcing people to wear face masks are two key steps the municipal government is taking to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, according to Nhan.
He added that the municipal Department of Heath must identify brands of high-quality face masks for the public, while local authorities must release a list of places that sell them.
He noted that wearing a face mask and keeping a safe physical distance from other people are the simplest and most effective disease prevention measures available.
Covid-19 is more dangerous than an enemy since (it does not follow) rules.
This is a favorable measure for fighting the pandemic, he said.
Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom were late in preventing coronavirus outbreaks and are suffering serious consequences.
By contrast, Japan and South Korea had strong and quick responses, so they have achieved positive outcomes in their fight against the disease, according to Mr Nhan.
He cited statistics from 10 countries, noting that the number of people infected with the disease reached 100 within a month but could later increase to 1,000 within 10 days.

Rice traders cry foul over sudden export ban.
Rice traders are unhappy with the sudden government ban on exports that has million dollar worth of cargo idling at ports.
Vu Thanh Son, CEO of the company, said that he was surprised to learn about the sudden ban, which means $2 million worth of Hapro rice on its way to the Philippines and Malaysia are now stuck in the Saigon Port in Ho Chi Minh City.
Contracts have been signed and money has been transferred.
The ban could result in a loss of reputation for the company and lawsuits from our partners.
Another exporter, Co May Group in southern Dong Thap Province, has had to suspend the export of four rice containers to Australia worth VND1.2 billion ($50,700), which was due this week.
We have been preparing a month for this order.
The ban will cost us a lot of human and financial resources, said a company leader.
The Loc Troi Group in southern An Giang Province has also had to cancel two rice orders on the way to the port.
Group Chairman Huynh Van Thon said they would have to renegotiate and do not know how the buyers will react to the news.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc ordered the export ban to be imposed 0 a.m Wednesday after the government noticed an unusual 32.6 percent year-on-year upsurge in rice export value in the first two months of this year.
Exports to China surged seven times in this period, according to official figures.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Tran Quoc Khanh Wednesday said that if the export surge persists in the upcoming months, Vietnam could face a domestic shortage of rice.
Rice exporters have said they agree with the ban and the need to ensure food security, but the government needed to give them a time frame to conclude their export orders to minimize losses.

Japan is now testing a robot cooking soba noodles at Tokyo station.
The robot, put at Higashi-Koganei Station on Railway Co.'s Chuo Line, is capable of making 40 soba dishes an hour, about the same as a cook's performance.
The robot takes charge of boiling the noodles while the staffs take charge of putting them on a plate and giving them to the customer.
Based on the information from the East Japan Railway Company, the trial period might be extended to April 15 with the aim to determine whether the robot can work well enough and satisfy the expectations of its noodle-loving customers or not.
According to a staff, by virtue of the robot, it is possible to beat the kitchen heat in the summer as well as the risk of burning from scalding noodle water.
Besides, while the robot boils up noodles, the chef is given an opportunity to have time to do something else, such as dealing with customers, cooking fried food and clearing away dishes.
Vietnam suspends rice exports to ensure food security.
A decision issued by Vietnam Customs Deputy Director General Mai Xuan Thanh asks all provincial and municipal customs departments to stop registering customs declarations, as well as receiving and clearing documents for rice export shipments starting Tuesday.
Rice shipments with customs declarations completed before Tuesday will be unaffected.
The decision follows the Prime Minister's statement at a cabinet meeting on the imperative of ensuring food safety amidst the complicated developments of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The ministry said it would reassess the actual output of the winter-spring rice crop, the amount of rice to be exported in signed contracts and the actual amount in businesses' inventories before suggesting a solution.
Vietnam is currently the world's third largest rice exporter after India and Thailand.
Last year, the country exported 6.37 million tons of rice worth $2.81 billion, with the top markets being the Philippines at over 2.1 million tons, Ivory Coast, over 580,000 tons, Malaysia, over 550,000 tons and China, 477,000 tons.
Over the past two months, Vietnam's rice exports to a number of countries have increased sharply following the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to a report by the Department of Agricultural Products Processing and Market Development, Vietnam exported 895,000 tons of rice worth $410 million in the first two months of the year, a 27 percent increase in volume and 32.6 percent rise in value year-on-year.
The Philippines continued to be the leading market for Vietnam's rice exports, but both the volume and the value of rice exported to this market were lower than last year.
On the other hand, rice exports to Mozambique, China and Angola increased 5.04 times, 2.76 times and 2.57 times respectively.
The average export price of rice in January was $478 per ton, a 7 percent increase over the same period last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has said that it would closely monitor the market's developments and increase, if possible, the total area of rice fields for the fall-winter crop from 750,000 hectares to 800,000 hectares.
Malaria drug not approved for coronavirus treatment.
Hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria patients, has not been approved as a cure for the coronavirus by the Ministry of Health due to its harmful side effects.
The ministry's Drug Administration on March 23 sent urgent dispatches to the country's provincial and municipal Departments of Health and drug stores nationwide on the management of the malaria drug.
The dispatches came after residents rushed to buy chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine due to rumors of its success in coronavirus treatment U.S.

Vietnamese teacher among 50 finalists.
Vietnam's Ha Anh Phuong is among the 50 finalists for the 2020 Global Teacher Prize for her contributions to education in remote areas.
From the 50 lists, a prize of $1 million will be given to an exceptional teacher who has made an outstanding contribution to their profession, according to the Varkey Foundation, a British charitable foundation that gives the award.
Phuong, 29, teaches English at Huong Can High School in a mountainous area of Thanh Son District in Phu Tho Province in the north, where many people cannot get good education for economic and geographical reasons.
Ninety percent of students in her school are of ethnic background.
Herself a Muong, Vietnam's third-largest out of 53 minority groups, Phuong decided to become an English teacher after watching a Vietnamese documentary about how teachers had knocked on people's doors in the remote mountainous areas to persuade them to send their children to school.
After getting a Master of TESOL at Hanoi University, she decided to return to Phu Tho and become a teacher there.
In her school in the remote, mountainous area, students have little chance to practice English with foreigners, which often leads to low language competence, shyness, poor intercultural awareness, and lack of interest.
Phuong has helped her students tackle this challenge by using online teaching models, connecting them with children in schools worldwide through Skype.
Some of her innovations have significantly improved student outcomes and are clearly seen in their national exam results.
Last year all her students, who had previously been low achievers in English, passed the final exam.
Known as the 4.0 innovative teacher in Vietnam, she has now taught students online on four continents (Africa, Europe, Asia, and America), and is an active member of a Microsoft educational community that gathers global teachers to design lessons and engage in professional development.
Last year she was awarded the Innovative and Creative Teacher prize by the Ministry of Education and Training.
With the new coronavirus epidemic still raging and schools closing, Phuong's online teaching model has special significance.
My students say they can study and lie in bed at the same time and can cough anytime without facing discrimination, she wrote in a Facebook post about teaching students at home.

Vietnamese woman claims she was attacked in Australia for wearing a mask.
A Vietnamese woman living in Australia has claimed her and her brother were attacked on a train because they were both wearing face masks.
Phuong Anh, who also uses the name Amber Mai, said during the attack no one else on the train tried to help.
She claims she was verbally assaulted and had a drink thrown on her before the man tried to punch her.
Phuong Anh wrote on Facebook.
Today on the train, me and my brother got assaulted for wearing a mask.
The guy verbally assaulted us, then threw drink on us, and physically tried to hit me after the argument.
And this is not the first time I experienced this.
Since she took to social media to reveal the incident, her post has been shared more than 3,000 times and she has been inundated with messages of support.
She wrote, this is hurtful.
I have always been telling my family, my brother beautiful amazing things about Australia.
That was the reason they decided to let my brother come here to study with me.
He has only arrived to Australia 4 months ago, and this is what he got to experience.
I feel ashamed.
Phuong Anh, who is originally from Hà Nội, said the matter is being investigated by police in Australia.

Vietnam prepares medicines for 10,000 Covid-19 patients.
Medical companies in Vietnam have been asked to ensure adequate supplies of medicines to serve at least 10,000 cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
The Drug Administration of Vietnam, under the Ministry of Health, sent this request to medical manufacturers and importers in the country, in preparation for a scenario when the pandemic worsens.
These businesses were told to ramp up the supply of pharmaceutical drugs and materials and work out business plans to meet the demand for health care facilities and essential medicines to treat the potential number of Covid-19 patients.
There are no vaccines or drugs available to fight the new coronavirus at present.
The Health Ministry's main method of treatment for Covid-19 is supportive care.
That means doctors treat the symptoms of infected patients and detect and address respiratory or kidney failures or other organ failures.
Also, the ministries of Health and Industry and Trade have just convened an emergency meeting to discuss the production and supply of face masks to fight the spread of the pandemic.
Vietnam has managed the domestic supply of mask materials, potentially producing 30 million face masks by the end of March, according to a representative from the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
One of the critical components of medical masks is nonwoven fabrics made from polypropylene resins.
Vietnam has exported this material for a long time, said Dang Hoang An, deputy minister of Industry and Trade.
To produce 1.5 million medical face masks, one ton of polypropylene resins is needed to produce one ton of nonwoven fabrics.
The country is in need of 30 million masks by the end of the month, equivalent to 20 tons of polypropylene resins needed, while local manufacturers are able to generate some 450 tons of this plastic resin annually.
Accordingly, Vietnam can still supply enough materials to produce 100 million masks, the deputy minister noted.

Second patient cured of HIV, say doctors.
A man from London has become the second person in the world to be cured of HIV, doctors say.
Adam Castillejo is still free of the virus more than 30 months after stopping anti-retroviral therapy.
He was not cured by the HIV drugs, however, but by a stem-cell treatment he received for cancer he also had, the Lancet HIV journal reports.
The donors of those stem cells have an uncommon gene that gives them, and now Mr Castillejo, protection against HIV.
In 2011, Timothy Brown, the Berlin Patient became the first person reported as cured of HIV, three and half years after having similar treatment.
Stem-cell transplants appear to stop the virus being able to replicate inside the body by replacing the patient's own immune cells with donor ones that resist HIV infection.
Celebrities asked to undergo health checks following Europe fashion weeks.
Nguyen Tan Binh, director of Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Health, on Monday, called on local authorities to tighten supervision on those having had contact with Covid-19 patients.

The fashion weeks attracted thousands of visitors from all over the world in French capital Paris and Milan, situated in the Lombardy region of Italy, and experiencing the largest number of Covid-19 infections outside Asia.
In the last few days, several Vietnamese celebrities returning from the fashion weeks have been quarantined at home.

Vietnam mulls health declaration for all Vietnamese citizens.
All Vietnamese citizens should be required to fill out health declaration forms starting Tuesday as the Covid-19 crisis deepens, officials have proposed.
The National Steering Committee for the Prevention and Control of Covid-19 made this proposal in the context of Vietnam recording 14 infections in just three days, raising the national total to 30.
The committee said Sunday that Vietnam asking health declarations from everyone arriving in the country from overseas is not enough.
The declaration needs to apply for Vietnamese residents as well, it said.
This is not only a responsibility but also a specific action for all Vietnamese people to join hands and unite to fight the epidemic, the proposal said.
The declared information will be strictly managed, exclusively serving the anti-epidemic agenda and will not be used for any other purpose, the committee added.
The Ministry of Information and Communications, the Ministry of Health, the Vietnam Social Insurance and other relevant agencies have been asked to complete the proposal that could take effect on Tuesday.
Visa suspension.
The committee also proposed that Vietnam suspends visa-free entry for European Union (EU) members and the U.K.
Countries outside the EU with more than 500 infection cases or more than 50 cases each day should also have their visa exemptions suspended, the committee suggested.
If a foreigner shows symptoms of Covid-19 infection, he or she should be denied a visa to enter Vietnam, it said.
The latest proposals and moves came after nine foreigners, including seven British, one Irish and one Mexican aged between 58 and 74, tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Vietnam after boarding the same Vietnam Airlines flight VN0054 as Hanoi's first Covid-19 patient, Nguyen Hong Nhung.
Earlier, Vietnam already required those arriving from mainland China, South Korea, Iran, and Italy, the worst-hit countries, to be quarantined for at least 14 days on arrival, apart from suspending visa-free entry for South Koreans and Italians.
Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam, head of the Covid-19 prevention committee, said that after the 17th case, Vietnam had officially entered the second phase of the war against Covid-19.
This stage is more difficult than the first because the epidemic has spread to more than 100 countries and territories around the world, he said.
We have to prevent the disease from hundreds of sides instead of a few sides like before.
In fact, the Covid-19 epidemic has invaded our country and is becoming more serious, Dam said.
However, he expressed his confidence that Vietnam would win the battle.
We have won the first round and will absolutely win the whole battle, he said.
Dam said Vietnam has foreseen all situations, having sketched out scenarios for coping with thousands of infections.
The most important thing is that we must continue to persistently implement the principle of preventing the virus from spreading, localize it and stamp out the epidemic.
Early detection is a very important task, Dam said.
He also suggested relevant agencies recommend that Vietnamese citizens limit overseas travel and avoid countries with the high number of Covid-19 infections at the moment, only go when absolutely necessary and fully equipped with the knowledge to protect themselves from the epidemic.
The Covid-19 outbreak has thus far spread to 104 countries and territories around the world, with the death toll climbing to 3,806.

The South Korean envoy has expressed concern Samsung may suffer huge losses if 1,000 South Korean experts are isolated upon arrival in Vietnam.
If experts and engineers of Samsung Electronics enter Vietnam and are placed in quarantine for 14 days, this giant can suffer great damage, Ambassador Park Noh-wan told reporters in Hanoi Friday.

The South Korean Embassy in Vietnam has proposed that the Vietnamese government adjusts its policy, allowing representatives of Korean businesses, including experts and engineers of Samsung and LG, to enter the country and not be quarantined.
South Koreans with diplomatic and official passports should also be considered for this policy, Park said, adding that all people with a medical certificate issued by Korean medical authorities should be allowed to enter Vietnam normally.
Park said the number of South Koreans coming to Vietnam has plummeted after Vietnam halted visa waivers for South Korean nationals starting February 29.
During the first two months of this year, only 100 South Koreans arrived every day, compared with the previous figure of 13,000, he said.
The ambassador said that from March 7, Vietnamese airlines are suspending all flights to South Korea.
Previously, there were 80 non-stop flights every day between Vietnam and South Korea, around 550 flights per week.

I hope that the two countries will take effective measures to prevent the (Covid-19) epidemic (from spreading) but not affect the two countries' long-term relations, he said.
South Korea sent three emergency response teams to Vietnam Thursday to provide consular support to more than 270 citizens quarantined over the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Kimchi ranks among the top healthy foods.
Kimchi is one of the most popular traditional Korean food.
This dish is made by fermenting vegetables (mainly napa cabbage and cabbage) and chili, which has a sour and spicy taste.
Kimchi is used in most meals and is an ingredient in many other Korean dishes.
Although there are hundreds of different types of kimchi, most types of kimchi have a strong and spicy aroma.
Kimchi has a long history.
In Korea, vegetables and fruits do not survive in the winter due to the cold weather, leading to food shortages during this time.
Therefore, Koreans have fermented vegetables as food reserves for the winter.
Some people think that kimchi may have appeared about 2,600-3,000 years ago.

However, coach Park had more posts and comments on social media (278,536) than Hai (140,625) and Phuong (102,015).
Buzzmetrics compiled the data based on coverage, interaction, events and other factors.
Topping the list was comedian, TV host Tran Thanh, followed by rapper Den Vau and pop singer Son Tung M-TP.
Quang Hai is a crucial player for both the national team and Hanoi FC, while Cong Phuong is finding his form at HCMC FC, scoring in two consecutive games of the AFC Cup.
Phuong's return to Vietnam from Belgium has attracted a lot of attention from the media and fans.
Vietnam requires health declaration from all arrivals.
Everyone arriving in Vietnam from overseas will need to fill out health declaration forms starting this Saturday.
Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam, head of the National Steering Committee on Covid-19 Prevention and Control, issued the order at a meeting Friday.
The arrivals can choose to file the declaration in paper or electronic form, via the Preventive Health Department website.
The Ministry of Health also requires those with symptoms like cough, fever, shortness of breath, and fatigue to be examined and quarantined.
Vietnam already required those arriving from mainland China, South Korea, Iran, and Italy, the worst-hit countries, to be quarantined for at least 14 days.
The Covid-19 epidemic has been spreading rapidly worldwide, affecting 89 countries and territories, with deaths reported across the world.
More than 98,000 cases have been recorded worldwide, including 3,385 deaths, most of them in mainland China, but also in Italy (148), Iran (108) and South Korea (40).
No new case has been diagnosed in Vietnam since February 13.
Vietnam now tests for coronavirus in 24 hours.
The time it takes Vietnamese experts to test for coronavirus infection has come down from four or five days to one.
It now takes experts at Hanoi's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) just 10-11 hours to make an accurate diagnosis from DNA sequencing.
At the beginning of the outbreak patients had to wait several days for the result.
NIHE has built up large stocks of test kits for screening Vietnamese nationals returning from South Korea, one of the main epidemic-hit nations and with a death toll so far of 33.
A Vietnamese is among the 5,328 diagnosed there as infected as of Wednesday.
Vuong Duc Cuong, a researcher at NIHE's virology department, said the institute currently receives around 70 samples a day on average, requiring its personnel to work overtime to deliver results quickly.
After cultivating and isolating the virus, NIHE transfers positive samples to a number of units to develop rapid test kits.
The state-owned Vaccine and Biological Production No.1 company has already started research to find vaccines using the samples.
There are 30 facilities including hospitals approved by the Ministry of Health to test for Covid-19, and all of them use NIHE test kits.
On Wednesday the number of people suspected to have the coronavirus infection in Vietnam was 77.
None of them are in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City or Da Nang, Vietnam's three largest cities.
Over 10,000 people have so far been quarantined in field hospitals or monitored.
While no new cases have been detected since February 13 in Vietnam, and all 16 who had tested positive have been discharged, the global death toll continues to climb, with the epidemic now reaching 76 countries and territories.
The death toll is 3,203, 2981 in mainland China, 79 in Italy, 77 in Iran, 33 in South Korea, nine in the U.S, and 12 in Japan, including six on a cruise ship.
One-legged Cinderella in Vietnam finds her prince.
Be Thi Bang had given up all notions of romance after losing a leg in an accident, but fate had different plans for her.
The 33-year-old, an ethnic Tay, was born in northern Cao Bang Province, graduated from the Thai Nguyen University of Medicine and Pharmacy, and was working for a dental clinic in Hanoi.
In 2012 a truck ran over her as she was walking on the street.
When she recovered consciousness after four days, she found her right leg had been amputated at the hip.
She tried to adjust to her new life, learning to walk with a prosthetic leg and a crutch.
She says, I thought I was lucky to be alive.
I did not dare dream of love.
But she started to get her life back on track.
She returned to work, practiced dancing on one leg and threw herself into voluntary activities.
Life went on until one day in mid-2016 everything changed.
She was seeing her friend off at the airport when she came across a German tourist, Oturak Be.
Seeing him struggle with a map, she offered to give him a hand.
Perhaps that was destiny, she says with a smile.
After a few days, she accidentally met him again in the West Lake area.
They became friends and spent a lot of time exploring Vietnam together.
They also visited Cao Bang, her hometown.
At first, he had no idea about her disability since she used an artificial limb, and only knew the truth when she showed him a video recording of her dancing on only one leg.
Surprised he praised her.
How can you dance so beautifully? Do you know how much I love Arabian and Persian dances?
One day he confessed to being in love with her, but she said, Give me more time.
When he was about to return home, he surprisingly proposed to her.
But, thinking she did not deserve him, she rejected it.
Her heart was shouting I accept, but her mind stopped her from doing so.
She was afraid she would be a burden.
Oturak then wrote her a long letter saying.
Please do not say that.
Dragon fruit bread of Vietnam on international newspapers.
This bread shows that Vietnam is ready to face the effects of coronavirus, said Business Insider.
Business Insider reported, A bakery in Vietnam has created a new type of bread, to take advantage of tons of unsold dragon fruit [stuck, unable to be exported to China] due to coronavirus outbreak.
A large number of dragon fruits cannot be exported, as Vietnam has closed most of its border with China due to coronavirus concerns.
In an effort to take advantage of the surplus of agricultural products, the chain of ABC Bakery in Ho Chi Minh City has developed a new formula - producing fresh pink bread batches, replacing 60% of water in the flour mixture by dragon fruit smoothie.
Even as the chain rapidly ramped up production to produce 20,000 loaves of dragon fruit bread a day.
Last week ABC Bakery said every customer just buy five loaves at a time.
Business Insider reporter came here to experience and commented, The pink bread stands out.
Although it was created to rescue crop in the coronavirus outbreak, it looks just like a piece of work to post on Instagram.
It's delicious, with a crispy outer layer, cool inside, full of flavor .
Business Insider said, this bread shows that Vietnam is ready to face the effects of coronavirus.
Italy became the largest Covid-19 outbreak in Europe, with 888 people infected.
The number of Covid-19 infections in Italy increased sharply from 650 on February 28th to 888 according to data published on February 29th.
Out of 888 people infected, 21 were killed, 46 were cured and discharged from hospital.
Most cases reported in the Lombardy region are 531 cases.
It is also the region where the majority of the deaths of Covid-19 are recorded in Italy.
Italy is currently the largest outbreak in Europe and the third in the world after China and South Korea.
Many countries in Europe, such as Greece, Spain, England, Croatia, Austria, Denmark, Germany, France, and the Netherlands, have reported new cases with most patients returning from Italy.
Especially in Germany, France reported a sharp increase in the number of recent cases including 60 cases in Germany and 57 cases in France.
In France, 2 patients died.
Speaking at a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in Napoli on February 27, French President Emmanuel Macron said that the fight against Covid-19 could only be successful with full cooperation at both the European and international community.
Brazil on February 28 confirmed that a citizen from Italy tested positive for Covid-19.
This is also the first country in Latin America with the case of the disease.
In the face of a complicated epidemic, many European countries have stepped up measures to prevent and recommend citizens not to come to areas affected by the epidemic in Italy.
However, Italy officials still seek to reassure the visitors, affirming their country as a safe and welcoming country.
Secretive energy startup backed by Bill Gates achieves solar breakthrough.
A secretive startup backed by Bill Gates has achieved a solar breakthrough aimed at saving the planet.
Heliogen, a clean energy company that emerged from stealth mode on Tuesday, said it has discovered a way to use artificial intelligence and a field of mirrors to reflect so much sunlight that it generates extreme heat above 1,000 degrees Celsius.
Essentially, Heliogen created a solar oven — one capable of reaching temperatures that are roughly a quarter of what you'd find on the surface of the sun.
The breakthrough means that, for the first time, concentrated solar energy can be used to create the extreme heat required to make cement, steel, glass, and other industrial processes.
In other words, carbon-free sunlight can replace fossil fuels in a heavy carbon-emitting corner of the economy that has been untouched by the clean energy revolution.
We are rolling out technology that can beat the price of fossil fuels and also not make the CO2 emissions, Bill Gross, Heliogen's founder and CEO, told CNN Business.
And that's really the holy grail.
Heliogen, which is also backed by billionaire Los Angeles Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, believes the patented technology will be able to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industry.
for example, cement production activities accounts for 7% of global CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.
Sonic the Hedgehog setbox office record for video game movie.
Collecting an estimated $57 million in ticket sales in North America last week, Sonic the Hedgehog has become the highest-grossing opening ever for a video game adaptation, surpassing the previous $54 million record held by Detective Pikachu.
In the markets outside of North America, Sonic the Hedgehog's overseas debut performance received warm responses from audiences, earning an estimated $44.3 million after its first three-day screening.
Based on the global blockbuster video game of Sega created in 1991, Sonic the Hedgehog concentrates on Sonic (voiced by Ben Schwartz), a hedgehog with sprint power at supersonic speeds, and his exciting adventure to discover the life on Earth.
Sonic pairs up with police chief Tom (James Marsden) to pit themselves against the evil guy's plot, Dr. Robotnik (Jim Carrey).
Until now, the titles of the Hedgehog movies have sold hundreds of millions of copies worldwide.
However, the film adaption process for the Hedgehog was really arduous.
A new solution for America's empty churches.
Over the past few decades, vacant and underutilized churches have become a familiar sight in American cities.
In some cases, a congregation or a religious governing body -- say, a Catholic diocese -- will sell the church to developers, who then turn them into apartments, offices, art galleries, museums, breweries or performance spaces.
But what about churches in neighborhoods that aren't doing well, areas that are less attractive to developers looking to turn a profit? In Buffalo, New York, two empty Roman Catholic churches were recently converted -- not into apartments or offices, but into other places of worship.
One became an Islamic mosque, the other a Buddhist temple.
As an architect and historic preservation planner, I was drawn to this phenomenon.
With the help of Enjoli Hall, who was then a graduate student at University at Buffalo, I interviewed those involved in converting the former churches.
With immigrant and refugee populations growing in post-industrial cities across the US, the conversion of vacant Christian churches into new places of worship can preserve historic architecture and strengthen burgeoning communities.
Buffalo has shown how faith-to-faith church conversions can be a win-win situation for everyone involved, The diocese gets to sell a redundant property, immigrants can acquire a property that will strengthen their community, and the city builds its tax base by attracting new residents to the area.
The mission to drill through the Earth's crust.
Last month, floating in the ocean south of New Zealand, a team of scientists were investigating the end of the dinosaurs and trying to predict the future.
They were unspooling Earth's history, raising up sections of sediment and ancient rock from beneath the South Pacific.
With these samples, scientists are probing some of our most longstanding, and most urgent, questions, What happened in the wake of the dinosaurs? What happens to life when the planet dramatically warms or cools? Can millions of years of Earth history tell us where we're heading?
The abyss may hold the answers.
Study Says Female Filmmakers Made Major Gains in 2019.
Lulu Wang, Lorene Scafaria, Melina Matsoukas and Greta Gerwig led Hollywood to a record year for women in film directing.
In 2019, women directed more of the most popular movies than in any year before.
Women directed 12 of the top 100 most profitable films in 2019.
That is the finding of a study released Thursday by USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.
That percentage of female filmmakers, 10.6, is greater than researchers have recorded before.
It suggests change is finally coming to a film industry where inequality in directing has remained common.
The past high in USC's yearly study was eight percent, in 2008.
In 2018, only 4.5 percent of the year's top films were directed by women.
This is the first time we have seen a shift in hiring practices for female film directors in 13 years, said Stacy L. Smith, a writer of the study.
She noted that Universal Pictures alone had five films with women directors in the top 100 movies.
The success of several of these films had already made 2019 a historic one for women.
Wang's The Farewell is one of the year's most popular independent releases.
Scafaria's Hustlers sold more than $100 million worth of tickets.
Also on the list was Matsoukas' Queen & Slim and Gerwig's Little Women.
Frozen II with $1.2 billion in worldwide ticket sales, is close to setting a new box-office record for a movie directed by a woman.
Jennifer Lee, who co-directed, set the record with the first Frozen film.
Other notable films included Kasi Lemmons' Harriet, Tina Gordon's Little and Jill Culton's Abominable.
USC researchers singled out Universal Pictures, where women directed 26 percent of the studio's films last year.
Universal's chief, Donna Langley, is the only woman to lead a major movie studio.
Paramount Pictures, in contrast, has not released a female-directed movie in the last five years.
Films from the streaming company Netflix largely bypass theaters so they remain outside the study's limits.
However, women directed 20 percent of Netflix's 2019 movies.
The Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University released a separate study Thursday.
It examined women in the top films as not just directors but writers, producers, executive producers, editors, and cinematographers.
Women accounted for 20 percent of all such work in 2019's top films, up from 16 percent the year before.
China penalizes irresponsible officials in the fightagainst corona virus.
Earlier this week, when leading a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed his resolute opposition against bureaucracy and the practice of formalities in taking preventive action.
He declared those who ignore the general guidelines or are irresponsible will be punished.
On February 4, an official of Red Cross Society in Hubei Province and a government official in Wuhan City (Hubei) were removed from their duties.
Moreover, two other government officials in Wuhan were penalized and a health official in another city in Hubei Province was fired.
Development of low-cost devices for quick identification of various viruses.
It was on December 23 that the Pennsylvania State University (US) released a study with the content that a device giving us a hand to quickly identify the various strains of viruses has been developed by researchers in this country.
It is estimated that about 1.67 million unknown viruses are in animals, some of which canspread the disease to human.
A number of viruses that can be transmitted to human such as H5N1, Zika and Ebola have led to outbreaks of disease and many deaths.
This is exactly why researchers at Pennsylvania State University and New York University have developed a handheld device with the aim to quickly test viruses at an affordable price.
It is called VIRRION.
By virtue of its small size and low cost, such this device will give assistance to clinics along with remote locations where disease outbreaks occur.
Besides, scientists have expectations that this device can be useful for identifying the infected portion of viruses, whereby it is possible to handle it effectively on the evolution of the virus at the right moment.

How technology is helping African farms to flourish.
A farmer's fortunes bloom and wither with the seasons.
It can be precarious work, and a bad year can leave fields barren and grain sheds empty -- slim pickings on which to survive until the next harvest.
More than half of working Africans have jobs in agriculture, but poor infrastructure, inadequate tools and a lack of investment have left the continent's mostly small-scale farms struggling to feed a growing population.
Now, a wave of technological solutions is aiming to help.
In Ghana, a company called Acquahmeyer rents out drones that help small-scale farmers check the health of crops and use pesticides only where it is needed, reducing pollution and health risks.
Chief operations officer Kenneth A. Nelson says,Ghanaian vegetables were not making it to the EU countries because of pesticide residues on the fruit and vegetables.
With drones, farmers can identify pests and disease to determine exactly which crops need spraying, Nelson says.
Thanks to the reduced use of chemicals (pesticide use dropped 50 percent in some cases), it's easier for farmers to meet EU countries' regulatory limits.
The company started in June 2018 with two drones and now has 10.
It makes an annual profit of $15,000 to $30,000 per drone, after operations and administration costs.
With more than 15 million hectares (37 million acres) of agricultural land in Ghana, demand for drones is only growing, says Nelson.
Volkswagen makes every effort to remain the position of the world's largest car manufacturer.
German automaker Volkswagen announced its business outcomes in 2019, which pointed out that its sales that year hit a record of 10.970.000 units and surpassed 10.830.000 units in 2018.
With these results, Volkswagen believes in the capability to maintain its position as the world's leading automaker which it attained in 2018 after defeating other rivals including Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance as well as Toyota.
The above results demonstrate the favorable business situation of Volkswagen in spite of the general dip in the global automobile market.
This associates with the growth in its market sales.
Its sales go up, rise thanks to its positive business outcomes in Germany, the US, and Brazil markets, whereas, its sales in the Asia-Pacific market experienced a downtrend.
The world's largest automaker used to be predominated by General Motors for over 7 decades before being taken over by Toyota in 2008.
New research shows men are more prone to corona virus than women.
Statistics at Jinyintan Hospital, which receives a large number of corona pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, show that more men are infected than women.
According to the South China Morning Post, a statistic based on 99 patients with coronary pneumonia being treated at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan City - the focus of the outbreak, shows that it seems men more susceptible to infections than females.
The study, which was just published in the medical journal The Lancet on January 29, was conducted by a team of doctors at Jinyintan Hospital, in conjunction with researchers from Shanghai Jiaotong University and Shanghai Ruijin Hospital.
The study was based on data from 99 patients, including 67 men and 32 women, who were hospitalized in Wuhan from January 1-20.
Scientists have found that nearly half of these people are infected in groups.
On January 21, Chinese authorities officially confirmed the case of human-to-human transmission.
We observed more men than women in 99 cases of 2019-nCoV infection.
It is reported that male is more susceptible to Mers-CoV and Sars-CoV than female, the study said.
Mers-CoV is the virus that causes Respiratory Syndrome in the Middle East (2012-2016), while Sars-CoV causes an acute respiratory syndrome that killed 800 people worldwide in 2003.
Both are coronaviruses.
The fact that women are less sensitive to the virus may be due to the protection of X chromosomes and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity, said the scientists.
Half of these 99 patients are people with chronic conditions like heart disease and diabetes.
The mortality rate for this 99 patient sample was 11%, lower than the 15% of the sample of 41 patients previously studied by Chinese scientists.
49% of these infected patients are related to the South China market, a seafood wholesale in Wuhan City.
Currently this market is still considered a source of disease outbreaks.
Vietnam has successfully cultured and isolated nCoV virus.
This is information published by the National Institute of Hygiene & Epidemiology (NIHE) on February 7.
Specifically, the Institute has cultured and successfully isolated nCoV in the laboratory.
This successful culture will contribute to rapid testing of nCoV infections and suspected cases.
And with this, every dayVietnam will be able to test thousands of specimens in case of need.
Mr. Dang Duc Anh - Director of the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology said that the virus was isolated from samples collected from infected patients in Vietnam.
Currently, Vietnam has more than 1,000 people returning from China and nearly 500 of whom have close contact with people infected with nCoV are isolated, monitored, monitored and waiting for test results.
This will be the basis for the research and development of vaccines against this virus in the future and also promote in making more effective preventive measures.
The strange pneumonia virus in China which is similar to Sars, probably originates from bats.
Chinese scientists say the strange strain of pneumonia virus may have a common origin with the Sars virus and originated from fruit bats.
A team of researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the People's Liberation Army and the Pasteur Institute of Shanghai used computer simulation data to analyze the impact of viruses on cells in the respiratory system of human.
According to the latest research of scientists, this virus is weaker than Sars but still very dangerous.
HKU9-1, the new virus shares the same origin with Sars, have been found in fruit bats.
The natural host of the strange pneumonia virus appearing in Wuhan may be a bat ..
but between bats and humans may have an unknown source of mediators, the research team said, according to the South China Morning Post.
On January 22, Gao Fu, director of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed the link between the virus and wildlife.
According to Director Gao, the strange strain of pneumonia virus that has recently spread from wild animals is on sale at Wuhan City's seafood market.
He also warned that the strain is changing and adapting, creating a great challenge for humans.
Earlier, experts said that the new virus could not cause a serious outbreak like Sars because of different genes.
However, new research shows that like Sars, the virus targets a protein called ACT3.
Upon further examination of the viral structure, the scientists found that its overall protein binding was highly similar to that of Sars.
In 2002-2003, the Sars outbreak broke out in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide.
Research is still ongoing to be able to fully analyze information about the new strain, how it is transmitted, and the consequences for humans.
Wildfires in Australia, Heavy rain appeared, becoming a savior for firefighters!
The BBC's reporter said that raining in some areas of wildfires in Australia helped bring down the temperature.
However, officials have warned that major fires are still likely to continue in the coming days.
Recently, the heavy rains have appeared on the east coast of Australia, from Sydney to Melbourne.
Heavy rains have also occurred in some parts of New South Wales (NSW).
Local officials said the rains were a savior for firefighters and areas damaged by wildfires.
However, they gave a warning that temperatures would continue to rise on Thursday and that the fires in Victoria and NSW could merge again, creating huge, intense fires.
Mr. Gladys Berejiklian, NSW Governor-General, said this morning, This is not the time to be happy when more than 130 fires broke out across the state.
What happened this morning is just a recovery, which can guarantee that people have moved to a safe place.
Although the heat has been temporarily reduced, the pollution from smoke from forest fires is still very high and dangerous.
Currently, the Australian National Museum in Canberra is closed to minimize risks to people, staff, and works of art.
The Australian National University (ANU) also ceased operations.
The Victoria Meteorological Department warns that visibility is now less than 1km in some parts of Melbourne and surrounding areas.
This weekend is the worst time of the wildfire crisis in Australia, with thousands of areas burned.
The big streets and cities are engulfed in the red sky phenomenon, filled with dust, which is making the air become mysterious.
Due to changing weather, the 5 states of the country have not received an emergency alert on Monday.
Previously, Victoria had 25 Watch and Act alerts, South Australia received one alert.
In NSW, all the alerts were at the lowest level, Advice.
However, the government said it is time to prepare a response plan when the wildfire could break out again.
Burning from December 28, wildfires in Australia devastated three states, killing 24 people and destroying nearly 2,000 houses, killing nearly 500,000 animals.
Thousands of tourists and residents have been stranded at the beaches, as this is the peak season of the summer vacation.
In order to evacuate people from the danger zone, two naval vessels were mobilized to the waters off the town of Mallacoota (Victoria), others in towns with damaged roads were removed by helicopters.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that more than 100 thousand AUD (69 thousand USD) will be used for relief work and pledged AUD 2 billion for remedial activities in the next 2 years.
In addition, he canceled a visit to India - scheduled to take place this week, due to a severe forest fire crisis.
In addition, the New Zealand government said it would send more firefighters next week to support neighboring countries to cope with uncontrolled wildfires.
The coal power plant will increase 19,223 premature deaths in Vietnam by 2030.
A report of Harvard University about the burden of disease from the emission of coal power plants in Southeast Asia said that coal emissions in this region will triple by 2030, the most serious in Indonesia and Vietnam.
Southeast Asia has a very high population density and is on the way of rapid development.
In particular, the majority of electricity demand growth is expected to be met by coal power.
Electricity demand in 2035 in ASEAN is forecast to increase by 83% compared to 2011, double the global average.
From a detailed analysis of coal-fired power plants currently being planned or under construction in Southeast Asia, the Burden of Diseases burden from emissions of coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asia of Harvard University scientists said that coal emissions in the region will triple by 2030, the most serious in Indonesia and Vietnam.
It is expected that by 2030, the number of coal power plants in Vietnam will increase to 133.
The report estimates that coal plants will cause 4,252 premature deaths in Vietnam in 2011, and increase to 19,223 premature deaths by 2030.
In 2011, most premature deaths were caused by ischemic heart disease (6470) and stroke (5970).
The premature death rate is the highest in Indonesia (7480 deaths per year), followed by Vietnam (4250 deaths per year).
China suffered the third-highest premature mortality rate after Indonesia and Vietnam with 3150 deaths each year.
In 2030, in the context of Southeast Asia's electricity generation is still expected to depend on coal.
Analysis of the report shows that a cost must be paid for human health is very serious.
The report estimates that around 20,000 premature deaths each year due to coal pollution from power plants currently operating in Southeast Asia, of which Indonesia and Vietnam are the two countries most affected.
These numbers could rise to about 70,000 deaths each year by 2030 if all coal plants currently approved in Southeast Asia come online.
The highest number of premature deaths will again be in Indonesia (24,400 premature deaths each year), Vietnam (19,220 premature deaths each year).
In addition to Indonesia and Vietnam, the third is in China, the number of premature deaths is expected annually to be9000 by 2030.China is strongly influenced by air pollution because this country is near Southeast Asia.
Myanmar will have the fourth highest mortality rate in 2030.
Now Indonesia is planning 176 new coal plants by 2030, of which 75 are under construction.
The risks come from Bitcoin.
As Bitcoin and other digital assets continue to grow, a common topic for discussion is whether the U.S government, or any government for that matter, can exert control of its use.
There are two core issues that lay the foundation of the Bitcoin regulation debate,.
The digital assets pose a macro-economic risk.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can act as surrogates for an international currency, which throws global economics a curveball.
For example, countries such as Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran have all explored using digital currency to circumvent United States sanctions, which puts the US government at risk of losing its global authority.
International politics and economics are a very delicate issue, and often sanctions are used in place of military boots on the ground, arguably making the world a safer place.
The micro risks enabled by cryptocurrency weigh heavily in aggregate.
One of the most attractive features of Bitcoin and other digital assets is that one can send anywhere between a few pennies-worth to billions of dollars of Bitcoin anywhere in the world at any time for a negligible fee (currently around $0.04 to $0.20 depending on the urgency.).
However, in the hands of malicious parties, this could be very dangerous.
The illicit activities inherently supported by a global decentralized currency run the gamut, terrorist funding, selling and buying illegal drugs, ordering assassinations, dodging taxes, laundering money, and so on.
Meanwhile, at about the same time, a pharmacist near North Carolina also developed a tonic called Pepsi, but it wasn't until 1903 that Pepsi's recipe was patented.
The problem is that this recipe might even have been before Coca-Cola's recipe.
Pepsi drinks also contain soda and kola seeds, but vanilla is used as the main ingredient in the replacement of coca because it is less anesthetic and tastier.
Despite competing in the same market, Pepsi made some wrong business decisions.
When Coca-Cola grew rapidly in the 1920s, Pepsi declared bankruptcy in 1923, only 20 years after being granted a patent.
It was not until 1941 that Pepsi was reborn in New York.
Here are some notable milestones,.
1880s, Pepsi's recipe was invented.

The Richest Musicians Of The Decade, From Taylor Swift To Beyoncé To Lady Gaga.
Yes, artists may have had to diversify their revenue streams, as people have stopped flocking to the local Woolworths or HMV to buy CDs, but you can argue that technology has brought huge investment opportunities for artists.
Anyone who has waited in an hour-long Ticketmaster queue for Beyoncé tickets will know that the demand is high, and tickets are as expensive as ever.
As 2019 draws to a close, Forbes has amalgamated its annual rich musicians lists to reveal just who has made the most millions throughout the decade, from 2010 - 2020.
The magazine uses touring data, music consumption numbers, interview agents and managers to assess the estimated wealth of living musicians.
Click through for a list of surprising and not-so-surprising revelations as to which musicians have made the big bucks this decade, in ascending order.
The A Star Is Born actress has amassed $500 million (£386m) thanks to the five albums she released throughout the decade (Born This Way, Artpop, Cheek to Cheek, Joanne and the A Star Is Born album) and live shows, including her Las Vegas residency.
The California Girl singer has earned $530 million (£410m) over the past 10 years, largely thanks to multiple huge world tours - California Dreams, Prismatic and Witness.
Despite The Beatles breaking up in 1969, the 77-year-old has earned $535 million (£413m) between 2010 and 2012 thanks to his ongoing solo career, which has involved world tours, a collaboration with Kanye West and Rihanna and a number one album with Egypt Station in 2018.
The rapper, producer and entrepreneur has earned $560 million (£433 m) over the past ten years, according to Forbes.
His accumulation of wealth has mainly come from the many companies he's built and invested in (champagne and cognac brands, Tidal, art collections and more) but he's also earned a tidy sum of money from two tours and an album with Beyoncé.
Considering all this, it's no surprise that Forbes titled him the first billionaire rapper earlier this year.
Google officially unveiled its Stadia cloud gaming service.
On November 19, Google officially launched Stadia, a livestream and gaming service that let players play games without having a hardware storage device.
The service supports a series of developing games with a reasonable cost.
What was announced by Google just several days before launching was that they would furnish 22 games when this service was unveiled, nearly twice as much as the number of titles that the company had pointed out before.
Google will compete with a vast of redoubtable rivals in the online gaming industry, laying a bet on the future of video games in cloud computing in lieu of traditional physical hardware devices.
For the time being, Microsoft is putting its Project xCloud service to the test and Amazon is rumored to develop its own cloud-based gaming service.
Just before Google launched Stadia, Playstation Now, which is a gameplay service on the cloud platform of Sony has been on sale lately.
The technology is possible, but it requires a company like a Google to really make it a reality, Google Stadia head Phil Harrison told CNN Business.
While Sony's Playstation Now service, for example, only works on PC and console, Google's supports a wider mix of platforms.
Stadia works on TVs with a Chromecast Ultra dongle as well as on most computers with a Chrome browser and on newer Pixel phones.
More devices are slated to be added in 2020.
The new step in identifying the cause of cancer and diabetes.
It is Australian scientists that have moved one step closer to discovering the cause of heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, and other diseases.
As the result of a long-term research, a team of scientists from Flinders University in South Australia has found out 148 new proteins that are influenced by cells damaged by stress as well as tiredness in the human body.
According to Justin Chalker who led the study, the above-mentioned new proteins have a relationship with heart disease, drug resistance in cancers and other cellular functions.
According to Mr. Chalker, this study not only is an important foundation that supplied new signs for biomedical scientists all over the world, but also gives them a chance to understand how the network of proteins work during the process of oxidative stress.
Based on the information from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), the leading cause of deaths in this nation in 2017 was one of the coronary artery diseases, followed by dementia and Alzheimer's disease along with lung cancer.
An exceeding 2m rise in sea levels is plausible by 2100.
Sea level could additionally rise 2 meters by 2100 and might plunge big cities like New York or Shanghai, if global temperature increased 5 Censius degree.
This is the latest research results obtained from scientists which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States on 20th May.
Fox News saidthat were sea levels to rise more than 2m as scientists announced the possible occurrence, the devastation could be catastrophic.
That the temperature increases by 5 degrees Celcius will engender significant declines in ice levels in Greenland as well as Antarctica.
The recent research results find out that the current sea level rise 3mm annually.
If the worst scenario happens with the global temperature rises by 5 0C, about 1.79 million square kilometers of land, more than three times compared to California state, will be inundated below the sea level and 187 million people, about 2.5% of the world population, will be at risk of disappearing together with their accommodation.
Why was Coca-Cola founded before but could not sue Pepsi for stealing inventions and Pepsi could not accuse Coca-Cola of copyright infringement? (Part 1).
The cola war has ended long ago and you may not believe this but Coca-Cola and Pepsi are on the same side!
The following article is shared by Robert Bonwell Parker, a lawyer specializing in litigation and entertainment law.
Note that because the subject is related to the two US companies, Robert only mentions the laws of this country!
Coca-Cola and Pepsi are currently the top beverage companies in the world.
Before getting into the story of Coca-Cola and Pepsi, let's learn a bit about intellectual property.
One important thing to keep in mind in the case of the two beverage giants, You can't defend an idea.
It is not intellectual property and you can only protect an idea once it becomes a product.
Intellectual property has four main areas of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret.
Copyright law protects useful things.
The protected group of people is the creator of the product.
When a person creates something, whether it's a piece of music, a novel, or a smart greeting card, they are all protected by copyright laws.
It is possible for other people to use the same idea but they cannot copy the specific way.
Patent law protects the development of science.
The protected group is the inventors.
When a person creates a new way to do something, he can claim his patent rights to that item.
Patents last only 20 years, and at that time anyone could create a general version of the patent that was granted.
Trademark law helps consumers avoid confusion and they are a group of people who are protected but not businesses as people think.
Trademarks can be words, symbols or distinctive characteristics that help consumers identify the origin of the products they buy.
The law of business secret has only been officially recognized since 1974 and became intellectual property protected by federal since 2016.
This law protects business secrets and the subjects protected are mainly companies with many employees.
Business secrets laws allow companies to prevent former employees or employees who are working for them from using, selling or disclosing business secrets.
These are the four main areas of intellectual property and the following are answers to many people's questions, Why doesn't Coca-Cola sue Pepsi?.
As we all know, Coca-Cola was founded in 1886.
Initially, it was created as an alternative to the addictive substance known as morphine (banned in the southern United States) by combining derivatives of cocaine (Coca) and caffeine (Cola, from African kola beans which contain caffeine).
Coca-Cola is patented as a new medication and is sold under the Coca-Cola brand.
Their first logo in 1888 was protected by both trademark law and copyright law.
Taylor Swift became the artist who received the most trophies in AMAs history.
Swift won six American Music Awards, taking her all-time total to 29 and breaking Michael Jackson's record, surpassing Michael Jackson's record of 24.
The artist of the decade honour was announced well before Sunday night's ceremony, but Swift also scooped the biggest prize of the night, artist of the year, from Drake, Ariana Grande, Halsey and Post Malone.
Taylor Swift deserves to be the most brilliant star of this year's American Music Awards 2019.
Taylor Swift shared the year of highs and lows as she was named both artist of the year and artist of the decade at the American Music Awards.
The artist of the decade honour was announced well before Sunday night's ceremony, but Swift also scooped the biggest prize of the night, artist of the year.
Accepting the award, an emotional Swift told the crowd gathered at Los Angeles' Microsoft Theater that the previous 12 months had given her some of the most amazing times as well as the hardest things I've gone through in my life.
Before she accepted the prize for artist of the year, Swift followed a video retrospective of her career to date with the performance of a medley of some of her biggest hits, opening with a brief portion of her song The Man, which debates how much more successful she would be if she were a male.
During her acceptance speech, Swift said the honour celebrated 10 years of hard work and of art and of fun and memories.
She added, All that matters to me is the memories I have had with you guys, with you the fans, over the years.
Earlier, Swift won favourite pop or rock album for her latest album Lover.
Her wins make her the most successful AMAs artist ever, dethroning Michael Jackson.
Selena Gomez kicked off the ceremony in her first live TV performance in two years, after undergoing a kidney transplant in 2017 and battling anxiety and depression.
Rapper Post Malone, whose seven nominations were the most of any artist this year, won favourite rap or hip-hop album for Hollywood's Bleeding.
Pop star Halsey won the prize for favourite pop or rock song for her hit Without Me, and Carrie Underwood won favourite country artist and country album of the year.
The ceremony included performances from singer Toni Braxton, 25 years after winning her first AMA, who belted out her 1996 pop ballad, Un-Break My Heart.
Meanwhile, new artist of the year nominee Lizzo treated fans to her single, Jerome.
Country music star Thomas Rhett and celebrity couple Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes were also among the performers.
Ozzy Osbourne, who spent much of 2019 recovering from injuries he suffered in a fall at home, returned to the stage to perform Take What You Want alongside Malone and Travis Scott.
Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain closed the night with a medley of songs – mashing up the biggest hits of the last 12 months with some of her own best-known tracks, including 1998's That Don't Impress Me Much.
Goo Hara died at the age of 28.
According to Korean media, Goo Hara passed away at her home.
The singer tried to commit suicide before.
On November 24, according to Money Today, Goo Hara was found dead at her home at 6,30 pm on the same day, Seoul police said.
Currently, the police have not announced the cause of the singer's death.
The K-pop singer's death comes six months after her manager found her unconscious at her home, in what local media described as an apparent suicide attempt.
The singer and actor later apologised to fans and recently relaunched her solo career with a tour of Japan and the release of a new single.
We received notice of Goo Hara's condition at 6,30 PM.
The police are investigating the cause of death, the police representative said.
Goo Hara shared on her SNS account, wrote, I have to pretend to be happy while I am tired.
Pretend to be nothing happens while I'm in pain.
After being suffered from all oppression, I'm broken into pieces from the inside.
Goo Hara is a former member of the popular Korean girl group - KARA.
KARA has gained many remarkable achievements in the way of music, dominating the Japanese market in 2010.
KARA is the first girl group of the land of kimchi to perform at Tokyo Dome.
The group disbanded in 2016.
First drug that can slow Alzheimer's dementia.
A US drug company says it has created the first therapy that could slow Alzheimer's disease, and it is now ready to bring it to market.
Currently, there are no drugs that can do this - existing ones only help with symptoms.
Biogen says it will soon seek regulatory approval in the US for the groundbreaking drug, called aducanumab.
It plans to file the paperwork in early 2020 and has its sights on Europe too.
Approval processes could take a year or two.
If successful, the company aims to initially offer the drug to patients previously enrolled in clinical studies of the drug.
The announcement is somewhat surprising because the company had discontinued work on the drug in March 2019, after disappointing trial results.
But the company says a new analysis of a larger dataset of the same studies shows that higher doses of aducanumab can provide a significant benefit to patients with early Alzheimer's, slowing their clinical decline so they preserve more of their memory and every day living skills - things that the disease usually robs.
Aducanumab targets a protein called amyloid that forms abnormal deposits the brains of people with Alzheimer's.
Scientists think these plaques are toxic to brain cells and that clearing them using drugs would be a massive advance in dementia treatment, although not a cure.
Former NASA scientist says they found life on Mars in the 1970s.
We may have already discovered the essence of life on Mars 40 years ago, according to a former NASA scientist.
Gilbert V. Levin, who was principal investigator on a NASA experiment that sent Viking landers to Mars in 1976, published an article in the Scientific American journal last Thursday, arguing the experiment's positive results were proof of life on the red planet.
The experiment, called Labeled Release (LR), was designed to test Martian soil for organic matter.
It seemed we had answered that ultimate question, Levin wrote in the article.
In the experiment, the Viking probes placed nutrients in Mars soil samples -- if life were present, it would consume the food and leave gaseous traces of its metabolism, which radioactive monitors would then detect.
To make sure it was a biological reaction, the test was repeated after cooking the soil, which would prove lethal to known life.
If there was a measurable reaction in the first and not the second sample, that would suggest biological forces at work - and that's exactly what happened, according to Levin.
However, other experiments failed to find any organic material and NASA couldn't duplicate the results in their laboratory - so they dismissed the positive result as false positives, some unknown chemical reaction rather than proof of extraterrestrial life.
But now, decades later, there are more and more promising signs.
NASA's Curiosity rover found organic matter on Mars in 2018, and just last week it found sediments that suggest there were once ancient salty lakes on the surface of Mars.
Reasons to Try Firefox Quantum Browser.
Mozilla has released a new update of its Firefox browser that it says is much faster and provides a better overall user experience.
But can the new version – called Firefox Quantum – compete with the world's current top browser, Google Chrome?
Firefox is an open-source browser created by the not-for-profit Mozilla Foundation.
The foundation says it has different goals than companies like Apple and Google, which must focus on making a profit.
Mozilla aims to create new products to keep the internet a global public resource that remains open and free to all people.
It urges developers to contribute to its technology and use the Firefox source code with other products.
Firefox 1.0 launched in 2004 when Microsoft's Internet Explorer dominated the browser market for personal computers.
Firefox also followed the failure of Netscape Navigator, another major browser that did not survive the competition from Internet Explorer.
Navigator had also been used in Mac computers.
But in 2003, Apple released its Safari browser, which is still used today.

World's first vagina museum to open.
The Vagina Museum opened this weekend thanks to a fundraising campaign, with more than 1,000 people donating nearly £ 50,000, or about 1.5 billion.
Florence Schechter, director of the museum, said her motivation was very simple, I found out that there is a penis museum in Iceland but there is no such place involving women, so I decided to open a Museum.
Florence said this is still a sensitive topic.
The museum's first exhibition will take place until the end of February 2020, named Muff Busters, Vagina Myths and How To Fight Them.
This art exhibition explains misconceptions about gynecology, including hygiene, structure, menstruation, sex, and contraception.
The program also cited YouGov's survey results in March.
Sarah Creed, exhibition manager, said, It was really surprising that half of the people surveyed didn't know where the vagina is, but I think that's what everyone knows.
Creed also revealed her underwear on display.
When the exhibition is over, the museum wants to focus on the history of menstruation and current socio-political issues.
The museum also displays products that gynecological care women do not really need.
A visitor to the museum.
It also displays gynecological care products that women don't really need.
The museum also hosts events, shows including comedy and a book club discussing feminist literature.
Visitors will receive leaflets and information about vaginal health.
This place also has a shop that sells everything from vagina postcards to cups.
Located in Camden Stables Market on Chalk Farm, the museum welcomes guests from 10 am to 4 pm from Monday to Saturday, and 11-18 pm Sunday.
This place is free to visit, except for events and concerts.
Why We Need Gold and Bitcoin ?
In today's digital age, we live in two worlds, the physical world and the virtual world.
The virtual world cannot exist without the physical world (power outages will attest to this).
But we cannot exist in today's physical world without the virtual world (digital technology has embedded itself into every aspect of life from personal to social to commercial).
Money, too, now exists in both worlds as cash and metals are being digitized.
The problem, government and banks are finding ways to make the digitization of money work toward their interests and advantages.at the expense of the people.
Government's monopoly over the creation, distribution, and regulation of fiat currency works against the principles of a free market.
Free market entails the freedom to use and hold any form of money that fulfills the demands of the market.
The notion of a free society also implies the individual's right to privacy (including transactions and asset holdings).
Government has severely restricted the freedom and privacy of individuals to conduct transactions and hold assets.
Government has monopolized money, making the manipulation, management, and artificial creation of money its sole privilege.
This is government's way of saying to its people, we can manage your wealth better than you can manage it yourself.
Gold and Bitcoin (and other acceptable altcoins) exist beyond this restrictive system.
Both operate outside the corruptive influence of government and central bank intervention and control.
Intrinsic Value, gold has physical intrinsic value—a commodity itself that has value beyond its currency value.
Bitcoin's intrinsic value is its generative process (algorithm) and coin limit as well as its underlying technological features and applications.
Scarcity, unlike fiat currency, gold is physically mined and finite.
Bitcoin (and a few other altcoins) is algorithmically mined and finite.
Inflation Hedge, both gold and Bitcoinare hedges against the inflationary degradation of fiat currency.
Universal Means of Exchange, gold and Bitcoin are recognized and exchanged across international lines.
Forgery-Proof, the quantity of gold can be reduced, but its material composition cannot be forged.
Bitcoin cannot be forged.
Risk of Confiscation, it would be impossible for the government to confiscate your privately-owned physical gold.
such a scenario would be virtually impossible with regard to cryptocurrencies.
In contrast, digitized currency and metals (via CUSIP) can easily be tracked, monitored, taxed, and seized.
Gold is the ultimate measure of value in the physical monetary domain.
Bitcoin and altcoins rule the digital monetary domain.
Wealth in today's world means owning assets in the form of sound physical and virtual money.
The U.S manufacturing dives to the lowest level within 10 years.
It was the U.S manufacturing that carried on slowing down in September, diving to the lowest level since 2009.
This is the result of a survey announced by the U.S.
Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on October 1stBased on the information from ISM, this is the second consecutive month of declines of the US manufacturing sector, showing a continuation of the downward trend since March.
What was proclaimed by the agency's survey was that the September manufacturing index decreased 47,8 percent, a sharp drop in comparison with the number of 49,1 percent of the previous month.
That the manufacturing index was below 50 indicates a step backwards.
A lot of opinions that the trade competition between America and China with the retaliatory tax measure is harmingbusiness and reducing confidence although the American authorities affirmed that this largest economy in the world has not affectedby the trade competition.
Can AI Now Determine a Person's Sexual Orientation?
According to some latest reports, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the ability to accurately identify a person's sexual orientation by analyzing photos of his face.
A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology showed that AI technology can surmise a person's sexual orientation by scanning a photo of his face.
The study was conducted by the lead researchers of the study, Michal Kosinski and Yilun Wang from the Stanford University.
The machine learning software which is used in the research can surmise signs of sexuality by analyzing the differences in facial structures.
With the right data sets, Kosinski said that an AI had the ability to see behavioral patterns that humans could not.
Also, the researchers claimed that the type of AI technology could also discover intimate traits, for example, a person's intelligence quotient (IQ) or political views.
Many critics worried about the use of the machine intelligence can violate a person's privacy as well as is used abused for anti-LGBT purposes.
Can the software threat to safety and privacy?
How the Chinese Celebrate Mid-Autumn?
Mid-Autumn Festival (Moon Festival) is a harvest festival, celebrated in China and other East Asian countries, such as Vietnam and Singapore.
It's always in September or October, on month 8 day 15 of the Chinese lunar calendar.
Also called the Moon Festival or Mooncake Festival, it is celebrated when the moon is believed to be the biggest and fullest, and mooncake is the main most characteristic festival food.
Mid-Autumn Festival is the second most important festival in China after Chinese New Year.
To the Chinese, the festival means family reunion and harmony.
It is celebrated when the moon is full, and Chinese people believe a full moon is a symbol of reunion, harmony, and happiness.
How the Chinese Celebrate Mid-Autumn?
Particularly on the evening of Mid-Autumn Festival, Chinese people get together with their family.
They eat dinner together with their extended family (usually three generations) at the grandparents' home.
Food for the dinner includes duck, taro, and other regional festival foods, which may take most of the afternoon to prepare.
After dinner, the family traditionally offer sacrifices to the moon, in the belief that the moon will bring them good luck.
The offerings may include mooncakes and symbolic fruits.
If the weather is favorable, they then appreciate the bright moon while eating mooncake.
During a bright moon night, many families choose to go outside to a park to gaze at the moon.
Other celebration activities include lantern shows and guessing lantern riddles.
There are grand lantern shows in Hong Kong and Zigong (Sichuan Province, central China).
Guilin has also had lantern shows in recent years.
Some regions like Hong Kong hold dragon and lion dances, which draw many participants and spectators.
The special Mid-Autumn customs of China's ethnic minorities are also very interesting.
Why Is the Moon Festival Celebrated?
In the past, the Moon Festival was celebrated at harvest time.
Ancient Chinese emperors worshiped the moon in autumn to thank it for the harvest.
The ordinary people took Mid-Autumn Festival as a celebration of their hard work and harvest.
Today, people mainly celebrate the moon festival as a time for family reunions.
When Did the Moon Festival Become a Festival?
Mid-Autumn was first celebrated as a national festival during the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127).
However, the festival has a history of over 3,000 years.
It was derived from the custom of moon worship during the Shang Dynasty (c.1600–1046 BC).
People have long believed that worshiping the moon and eating together around a round table would bring them good luck and happiness.
What the Chinese Eat for Mid-Autumn Festival?
Mooncakes are the must-eat Mid-Autumn food in China.
They are a traditional Chinese pastry.
Chinese people see in the roundness of mooncakes a symbol of reunion and happiness.
Other foods eaten during the festival are harvest foods, such as crabs, pumpkins, pomeloes, and grapes.
People enjoy them at their freshest, most nutritious, and auspicious meanings are particularly associated with round foods.
Festival food traditions are also changing.
The younger generation have their own ideas about what should be eaten.
Most of them don't like mooncakes, and prefer to eat what they like.
Hundreds of new fires burst forth in the Amazon.
On August 26, hundreds of new fires erupted in the Amazon, Brazil, regardless of the fact that military aircraft made efforts to put the fire out and the Group of Seven nations (G7) - the world's major industrialized countries- gave an assurance to help combat with wildfires raging in this country.
Based on the latest figures released by Brazil National Institute for Space Research (INPE), it was not until August that the number of forest fires in Brazil was 80.626 - the highest number recorded since 2013.
More than half of the fires took place in Brazil basin, where over 20 million citizens are.
In particular, on August 24 and 25 alone, 1.113 new fires burst forth.
Having spoken toward the press, what Sergio Pereira, the director of a children's hospital in Porto Velho said was that, In some way we're all passive smokers.
The smoke can be really aggressive and the most affected are children and the elderly.
A whole range of places of the world's largest rainforest - inherently playing a substantial role in making efforts to control climate change - have been burnt in the most appalling wildfire disaster for many years.
Experts said that increased land clearing during the months-long dry season to make way for crops or grazing has aggravated the problem this year.
On August 26, Brazilian Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said the government would try to prevent forest burning for agricultural land.
In the face of the endangered Amazon forest fire, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro authorised military operations in seven states in Brazil, including Rondonia, to fight Amazon fires.
Currently there are 44,000 troops will be available for unprecedented in Amazon region.
A bunch of countries around the world are also busy managing Facebook and Google.
Several years ago, Andreas Mundt once raised his voice with an aim to raise the alarm about the users' data collected by tech giants such as Facebook or Google.
The fact is that a variety of issues Andreas Mundt mentioned have been the hot spot for the technology world recently.
According to Mundt, people are exchanging their own personal data for the purpose of using free online services provided by Google as well as Facebook.
What Mundt said was that we had no other choice, because these companies had no real competitors.
It was in February this year that the Germany Antitrust Agency ruled that Facebook was breaking the law.
This verdict required Facebook to stop sharing users' data for game applications on social network or Instagram and WhatsApp, the two platforms that this social network owns.
This is also the first antitrust ruling on Facebook made in Europe.
This comes in the context of US lawmakers arguing whether technology giants should be accused of breaching antitrust orders violent or not.
Typically, this will be based on considering whether the behavior of an object impacts on user's interests.
However, this is a very difficult thing to prove with free services like Google or Facebook.
Mushroom Hunting Gains Popularity in US.
What used to be an outdoor activity for only extreme foodies is now becoming more and more popular in many parts of the United States.
I am talking about mushroom hunting! Mushroom hunters – also called foragers -- spend hours, even days, in wooded areas searching for wild mushrooms.
Dennis Aita lives in New York City.
He has been a mushroom hunter since the 1980s.
He first became interested in them while exploring the Appalachian Trail in the 1970s.
As he hiked, he began noticing mushrooms and other wild edibles.
So, he decided to try foraging for mushrooms.
Aita says mushroom foraging changed his relationship with the environment.
When hiking, he says, he would walk quickly and not see much of the plants and trees around him.
However, to find mushrooms, you must walk slowly.
Um, by looking for mushrooms, you tend to slow up a little bit.
You get a chance to see the birds.
You get a chance to see the trees and shrubs, little animal life and everything.
So, it is necessary to pay close attention to the details on trees and on the ground.
But this presents its own problem.
Mushroom foragers, with their heads turned downward, can easily get lost in the woods.
In the States, people have died after spending all night unprotected in the cold woods -- lost while hunting mushrooms.
Should AI be used to catch shoplifters?
New artificial intelligence software is being used in Japan to monitor the body language of shoppers and look for signs that they are planning to shoplift.
The software, which is made by a Tokyo startup called Vaak, differs from similar products that work by matching faces to criminal records.
Instead, VaakEye uses behavior to predict criminal action.
Company founder Ryo Tanaka said his team fed the algorithm 100,000 hours worth of surveillance data to train it to monitor everything from the facial expressions of shoppers to their movements and clothing.
Since VaakEye launched last month, it has been rolled out in 50 stores across Japan.
Vaak claims that shoplifting losses dropped by 77% during a test period in local convenience stores.
That could help reduce global retail costs from shoplifting, which hit $34 billion in 2017 according to the Global Shrink Index.
Using AI to catch thieves raises all kinds of ethical questions.
While the incentive is to prevent theft, is it legal or even moral to prevent someone from entering a store based on this software? said Euromonitor retail analyst Michelle Grant.
This should not be up to the software developer, says Tanaka.
What we provide is the information of the suspicious, detected image.
We don't decide who is criminal, the shop decides who's criminal, he said.
The UN Secretary General made a commitment to leveraging resources to stop the Ebola epidemic.
On May 8, the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the UN would throw its support to end the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The UN Secretary-General also noted the full involvement of the local people in this fight against the epidemic, considering it as the key to get successful control of the epidemic.
In its tenth month, the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has left more than 1,000 dead.
The outbreak of Ebola is mainly in North Kivu and the surrounding area of Ituri.
It is considered as the world's second-worst outbreak of Ebola epidemic after the epidemic killing more than 11,300 people in West Africa in 2014-2016.
Dandelions, One of the Healthiest Foods on the Planet.
In many parts of the world, spring is in full bloom.
Flowers of all colors and shapes can be seen in gardens, parks and other green spaces.
They make our world look and smell better.
So, it is no surprise that people love flowers! Well except for one.
Dandelions! There is probably no flower more hated, or misunderstood, than the bright yellow dandelion.
In the United States, they are considered weeds, the name for any unwanted plant.
In an effort to have the perfect green grass lawn, people try their best to kill all dandelions with chemical products.
Or they dig them out at the roots - only to see them grow right back.
Dandelions are hard to kill.
And that is a good thing because they are actually one of the most nutritious foods in the world.
That's right, dandelion haters, The most hated flower on Earth is one of the healthiest to eat!
Manchester City braced for possible ban from $1.5 billion Champions League.
Investigators from European football's governing body will meet Thursday to decide whether Manchester City will be banned from competing in the lucrative Champions League, according to a member of the investigatory chamber.
The New York Times reported Monday that the newly crowned English Premier League champion could be banned from Europe's most prestigious club tournament over allegations of unfair financial practices.
Petros Mavroidis, a member of UEFA's Club Financial Control Body Investigatory Chamber, told CNN Sport he was surprised by the information contained in the report because no final decision had been taken.
The New York Times had reported that investigators would recommend a season-long ban.
CNN contacted another member of the CFCB who declined to comment.
City will have the opportunity to appeal any potential punishment to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Switzerland.
UEFA told CNN that they do not comment on ongoing investigations regarding financial fair play matters.
Manchester City strenuously denies any financial wrongdoing and has welcomed the UEFA investigation, which is handled by the Club Financial Control Body Investigatory Chamber.
Manchester City FC is fully cooperating in good faith with the CFCB IC's ongoing investigation.
In doing so the club is reliant on both the CFCB IC's independence and commitment to due process, the club statement read.
The New York Times report citing people familiar with the case is therefore extremely concerning.
The implications are that either Manchester City's good faith in the CFCB IC is misplaced or the CFCB IC process is being misrepresented by individuals intent on damaging the Club's reputation and its commercial interests.
Or both.
UEFA has been investigating the club for possible breaches of its Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations since leaked files were reported by Der Spiegel.
French widow sues Boeing for $276 million over Ethiopian Airlines crash.
A French widow has filed a lawsuit against US aircraft manufacturer Boeing for $276 million in damages over the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max 8 in March, which killed all 157 people on board -- including her husband.
Frenchwoman Nadege Dubois-Seex, whose husband Jonathan Seex died in the accident, filed the suit against Boeing in Chicago, where the company is headquartered.
It is a tragedy which, by definition, could have been avoided, because it had already happened five months before.
How could they stay deaf to this warning? Dubois-Seex told reporters in Paris on Tuesday, referring to another Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesian company Lion Air's fleet that crashed last October, leaving 189 people dead.
Boeing admitted Saturday that it had to correct flaws in the flight simulator software used to train pilots on the 737 Max, following the two deadly crashes that killed a total of 346 people.
The aerospace company did not share when or how the flaws were discovered, however.
The admission of the simulator-software flaw comes amid intense scrutiny on Boeing and the design of its 737 Max.
The plane's MCAS software, which pushes the nose of the aircraft down if it senses an imminent stall, is believed to have played a role in crashes of Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines jets.
Boeing spokesman Peter Pedraza declined to comment on the lawsuit, but noted that the company was cooperating fully with investigations into the Ethiopian Airlines crash.
Jonathan, who was a Swedish and Kenyan citizen, leaves behind three young children aged 7 to 10.
The family's lawyer Nomaan Husain said that the evidence clearly demonstrates that Boeing acted recklessly and with conscious disregard to the safety of its passengers.
The chief of AFP bureau chief was expelled from Algeria.
On April 9th, the AFP chief of France in Algeria, namely Aymeric Vincenot, was expelled from this country, in wake of that Algerian authorities had turned down to renew his press extension in 2019.
Having been in the position of the AFP's bureau chief in Algiers since 2017, Mr. Vincenot, who is 45 years old now, was departed Algeria after his residency permit wasout of date and the final police deadline to leave had gone by.
Algerian authorities did not give an official statement to AFP for their decision as well as the reasons of Vincenot's deportation, but there was only a complaint to AFP's senior members in their visit to Algeria in March.
Responding to the above-mentioned move, AFP Chief Executive Fabrice Fries judged the decision, taken under the presidency of Bouteflika, was unacceptable for AFP on account of that they could not currently appoint a successor in these circumstances.
The internet is approaching its thirtieth birthday, or thereabouts.
We've come a long way since those early days of floppy discs and dial-up modems.
The internet is no different, as that issue seems to have also crossed over into the digital realm.
Popular services like Google, Facebook, and Twitter to name a few are directing much of our information consumption and data storage these days.
In the '90s there was a lot more peer-to-peer information sharing going on.
The dynamics have changed.
What was initially built as a decentralized scientific sharing network has more or less morphed into a giant marketing tool for a few big players.
Blockchain internet advocates argue that much of the information we access or store on the modern internet is controlled by gatekeepers.
In some cases, their presence is subtle and in others rather dramatic.
Either way, it's somewhat questionable whether these keepers hold our best interests at heart.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a nonprofit organization based in California.
It was initially formed to help the US government manage the early infrastructure of the internet.
ICANN oversees the Domain Name System (DNS), which, in simple terms, translates the numbers identifying servers around the world into a more readable format.
While ICANN provides a much-needed service, it also suffers from the same problems as large tech giants like Microsoft and IBM, centralization.
US policy heavily influences ICANN and, even though it doesn't regulate web content, it can censor domain names.
The nonprofit has controversially maintained a six-year ban on .islam and .halal domain names.
This is despite advice otherwise from its own oversight committee.
For the most part, ICANN has promoted the free speech ideals of the internet since its inception in 1998.
These recent events, however, call into question the real democratic future of DNS on a global stage.
If that was troubling then we only need to look across the Pacific to the heavy internet censorship found in much of Asia.
In China, the government maintains strict controls over what content can be seen and who can be criticized.
Internet communities aptly call it the Great Firewall of China.
As observed below, internet censorship mostly affects countries in the East, but even countries such as the UK and US, long held as pillars of freedom, are seeing increased issues with censorship.
Government Censorship.
Worldwide sharing of information is a tricky business.
Search engines have become a ubiquitous way for people everywhere to find their favorite content.
Latest estimates show that Google has captured 90 percent of the market share in this space.
While it clearly provides a valuable service, it also wields a lot of power.
Though many of us don't question this, a one search engine to rule them all approach is probably not the best way to serve impartial content.
The same can be said of social media.
It's doubtful that Mark Zuckerberg knew the full impact of his platform when he began building it in 2005.
Even Mr. Zuckerberg would probably admit that his pet project has deviated from its initial intentions.
In Facebook's case, there's the added element of identity management, since many websites use Facebook profiling to identify their users.
What's more, users face the very real possibility of losing valuable data.
Though not recommended, many users post photos and create content on Facebook that isn't backed up anywhere else.
By now, it should be clear that distributed systems have some real advantages.
Tamas Kocsis is the creator of ZeroNet, a peer-to-peer website hosting solution.
Zeronet removes traditional centralized hosting servers by allowing users to host their websites on other users' machines worldwide.
Sounds great but what prevents others from vandalizing your site? Bitcoin cryptography of course!
As long as you hold on to your private keys, your website remains secure.
Only you can add, edit, and update content in the usual way.
In addition, it's also more robust.
Graphite docs is a decentralized document authoring solution similar to Google Docs.
Google ultimately uses every piece of data you input for marketing purposes, whether it's through search, docs, or maps.
Data breaches are common these days, and large storage companies are quickly losing credibility as a safe way to independently manage user data.
With Graphite docs, the application distributes and secures your data with the same cryptography mentioned earlier.
Only you, however, can access it.
You still retain full control over your data at all times, from anywhere you happen to be on the planet.
These are just some of the cases where decentralized cryptocurrency architecture is changing the nature of the internet.
If you've used something like Graphite Docs or ZeroNet you will know that the process is still a bit technical and clumsy.
This speaks to the development of the industry as a whole right now.
Just like the early days of the internet, the base layers of blockchain are currently being built out.
Once developers iron out the kinks, we should see user interfaces appear that provide users with a more seamless interaction.
Bitcoin Scams and Hơ To Avoid Them.
Bitcoin has taken the world by storm, and since its introduction in 2008, it has inevitably faced several controversies.
Scammers found a gold mine in the digital currency for many reasons.
One of them is the fact that only a few people understand it, which makes it easier to make them believe false promises.
Another reason is anonymity – cryptocurrency gives scammers relative ease to cover their tracks.
What are the most common bitcoin scams and how do you spot them?
Fake Bitcoin Exchanges.
One popular example for these would be South Korea's BitKRX, which posed to be a branch of the country's Korean Exchange (KRX) and claimed to be a platform to exchange and trade bitcoin.
Ultimately, it turned out to be fraudulent.
There are also those that pretend to be connected with well-known exchanges using apps or fake websites.
users are scammed when they log in and their account details are given away.
When you are directed to a website, make sure that the URL has HTTPS rather than just HTTP.
Without the letter S, it means that the web traffic has no security and encryption.
Someone promises an incredible return of investment using bitcoin and a lot of people buy in it.
Before you know it, someone runs off with all of your money.
That's basically how Ponzi schemes work.
At first, victims will be made to believe that it actually works – say, the digits in their bank account are increasing.
This will also make them talk about its success and convince others to join in.
Eventually, calls to the customer service are unanswered, there are technical problems with the website, or the money will be remitted late – among several excuses while your money disappears for good.
If you see ads that sound like, double your bitcoin overnight, they're probably scams.
How it usually works is you have to send them your money first before they can double it.
Scammers use bitcoin as a product in pyramid scams.
In these schemes, your low initial investment will be multiplied if you invite more people to sign up.
After a lot of people have invested their money, the original scammer walks away with all the money.
Hackers have long been using malware in order to get a hold of other people's login credentials and account details.
Now, it's being used to drain Bitcoin wallets that are connected to the Internet.
How do you avoid falling into these scams?
If the offer is too good to be true, stay away from it.
Be vigilant on social media – legitimate bitcoin traders and brokers can be victims of poser accounts or impersonators.
Never conduct financial transactions via direct messages on social media platforms.
Do your homework and research on services you encounter and the best trading platforms.
verify their claims and check their legitimacy or whether they are a registered corporation or not.
The 7-year-old boy earns hundreds of billions thanks to YouTube.
It's the boy that earns $22 million (over VND 512 billion)a year by reviewing toys on YouTube and he became the world's highest-paid star on YouTube - a video sharing website when he was just a 7-year-old boy.
According to Forbes, within 12 months (until June this year), the Ryan ToysReview channel of Ryan earned more $500.000 than Jake Paul actor's channel did- the second highest paid one on YouTuber.
The Dude Perfect channel came in third place generating $20 million.
Video clips are posted almost every day and an advertisement clip which promotes a blue giant mystery egg with the appearance of Ryan has attracted more than a million views since last weekend.
Asked by NBC about the reason why many kids liked watching his videos, Ryan who is now 8 years old said, Because I'm entertaining and I'm funny.
Since the Ryan ToysReview channel was launched by Ryan's parents in March 2015, videos that he made have had 26 billion views and attracted up to 17.3 million subscribers.
Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Litigation.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are gaining more attention as days pass.
Aside from the advantages that cryptocurrencies have like anonymity and easy international transactions, people are enticed by the fact that it can become a good investment.
Apart from trading bitcoins for cash, you can also use bitcoins to buy gift cards, book flights, and hotels, buy furniture, or even buy real estate properties.
Bitcoin purchases are not taxed at the moment since there is no way for third parties to identify, track, or intercept transactions that use bitcoins.
Transaction fees are considerably lower as well compared to credit card transactions or services like Paypal.
Although there are many advantages in using bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, just like any other investments, you should always be careful with your transactions.
Since cryptocurrency is not regulated, many unscrupulous people have taken advantage of this and incidents of fraudulent cryptocurrencies, and other types of scam related to cryptocurrency have happened.
One example of this is Prodeum, a cryptocurrency start-up that scammed its investors in just one weekend.
Because of these scams, law firms have now been involved in helping the victims.
Cryptocurrency litigation has now become something that some lawyers specialize in.
There are a lot of factors to consider when a cryptocurrency dispute arises.
Aside from fraudulent Initial Coin Offering (ICO), lawyers could get involved if the cryptocurrency was used to launder money or hide assets.
they could also get involved when there is an issue with the company, commercial, or intellectual property laws being violated in relation to cryptocurrency.
Here are some things that you can do as a cryptocurrency user to avoid being scammed,.
Research.
Just like with any other investments that you will make, research is essential.
When investing in an ICO, make sure to read and dissect their white papers to ensure that you're working with reliable people.
Take time to research the people behind the ICO, their whole team, board members, and other investors.
It's vital for you to learn as much as you can about the company before investing so that there will be no unpleasant surprises.
Be vigilant.
Cryptocurrency is still primarily bought and sold at exchanges.
Because cryptocurrency is something new and the fuss around it is its value, many people get scammed by the promise of unrealistic prices.
If an exchange promises incredible discounts or offers that seem too good to be true, it probably is.
Another thing that you can do to avoid bitcoin exchange scams is to check the exchange's URL.
If a website's address starts with HTTPS instead of just HTTP, that means that the traffic is encrypted and therefore has more protection.
Only use trusted sources.
Hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys.
Hardware wallets offer more protection from hacking since there is no way for hackers to access them when you're not online.
However, hackers have now found a way around that.
Some hackers sell hardware wallets that have a backdoor for them to access all your cryptocurrency and the best way to avoid this is only to accept hardware wallets from trusted sources.
United Nations appeals for eliminating the violence against women and girls.
On November 19th, Antonio Guterres who is the secretary-general of United Nations broke the news of a persuasive message to the entire the world, saying ending inequality means ending violence against women and girls.
The aim of the speech of the secretary-general of United Nations Guterres at the celebration of The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against women is to assert that, At its core, violence against women and girls in all its forms is the manifestation of a profound lack of respect­ ­– a failure by men to recognize the inherent equality and dignity of women.
He also underlined was that the violence for women is the top-ranking reason of the loss and even a wide range of deaths of young women.
The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against women is celebrated once a year by United Nations on November 25th.
At this event this year, with the topic Orange the world, Hear me too,  will start with a series of 16 days with a lot of active actions which are initiated by UN with a goal to appeal everybody from a plenty of different fields for joining hands toget rid of the violence against women and girls.
Ms. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, Executive Director of the United Nations Women Program, emphasized that UN initiatives to change the lives of women are showing hope for more progress in gender equality.
South Korean ICO Ban May Be Lifted in November.
Seoul, South Korea.
This morning at the 2018 Korea Blockchain Expo, Representative Hye Hoon Lee, hinted at the South Korean government changing its stance on ICOs.
Mrs. Lee is the nominee for Chairwoman of the National Assembly Special Committee for the 4th Industrial Revolution.
The special committee was formed to pay attention to AI, big data, cloud computing, IoT, and other emerging technologies that are central to Korea becoming more competitive at the national level.
She mentioned that the government is presently reviewing ICOs taking place abroad before making a final decision on South Korean ICO guidelines.
According to her presentation, the government ICO study will conclude shortly and the government will most likely reverse its ban on ICOs in November.
She said that the lack of investor protection needed to be addressed and that the committee would, with the help of more knowledgeable leaders in industry and academic research, work with the government to develop guidelines that would regulate ICOs more like regular private businesses raising funds publicly.
She also stressed the need to punish violators.
During the presentation, she lauded the efforts of the US SEC.
This may have caused other presenters, like Simon Kim, the CEO of Hashed, asuccessful Korean cryptocurrency fund, to express concern about the government introducing very detailed or innovation-stifling regulations.
Mr. Kim seemed to make an appeal for light-touch, innovative guidelines that would push Korea to the forefront of cryptocurrency test markets.
Other speakers indicated that any government guidelines on ICOs would be beneficial for the South Korean economy.
Al can help to look for people through a camera based on height, gender, and clothing.
A team of AI researchers from India have developed a tool that can help to search for people in surveillance cameras by height, clothing color, and gender.
What you need to do is to provide the AI system with the detail information of a person who you're looking for and then it'll give you some videos that respond to your request.
For instance, you make a request of finding  women wearing a red T-shirt and being 153 tall, and the AI will give you all of the results including videos that feature people meeting your criteria.
Based on this team, now it can only look for someone based on height, clothing color, and gender.
This technology is a very good idea in looking for a missing individual or tracking suspected criminals.
Let's take imagination about a situation that someone disappears for a couple of days.
It's hard and time-consuming for humans, meanwhile, AI can completely solve it quickly.
The first successful genome editing experiment.
Recently, American scientists have successfully tested the genetic selection technology on human embryos to edit disease-causing mutations for the first time, creating opportunities to prevent genetic diseases from passing to future generations.
This is considered one of the important milestones in genetic research published in the British prestigious journal Nature.
The experiment was carried out by the experts from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) in collaboration with Salk Institute and Korea Genetics Institute.
The research team used CRISPR-Cas9 as a method to edit the mutant genes that are responsible for a heart disease.
CRISPR-Cas9 works as molecule-sized scissors that remove unwanted genes from the genome and replace with new healthy chains of DNA.
That technology has also been tested several times in China, but the results have not been clear.
In spite of the failure to achieve complete success, that gives a hand to increase the number of embryos that can be edited from the level of 50% in nature to the level of 70%.
Scientists are still cautious to give a warning that they need to do more tests to increase the level of success to 100%, and they ensure the safe levels before being able to bring the technology into reality tests.
We waste each year $500 billion on shopping and using fashion products each year.
Waste has become the focus problem for the fashion industry in recent years while the information of the huge inventory of fashion companies has been continuously released.
Especially, the big fashion brands like Burberry destroyed unsold products.
The latest research of Movinga tapped another aspect when focusing on the rate of consumers' waste, in the context of the fact that the number of fashion items is produced, consumed and removed faster than ever.
The study was conducted with the primary purpose which is to remind consumers about the effectsof the habit and myths related to the consumption of fashion items on the global scope.
Movinga aims to raise awareness and create positive changes in the community.
The research group conducted the survey with 18,000 households in 20 countries.
The research questions revolved around the percentage of outfits which have been not used in their lockers within 12 months.
After having completed the survey, Movinga collated the results with data from the World Bank and other research materials on this topic.
The results showed that the value of clothes is almost unused and recycled up to about $ 500 billion.
This is equivalent to an American citizen throwing nearly an average of 32 kilograms of clothing a year.
5.9 magnitude earthquake shook the Puerto Williams port of Chile.
According to reporters of Vietnam News Agency in Latin America, on October 29th, National Seismic Center (CSN) in Chile University said that an earthquake with 5.9 magnitude had shaken Puerto Williams port, which is 2400 kilometer away to the South from Capital Santiago.
According to CSN, hypocenter of the earthquake was 305 kilometer away from Puerto Williams port and at the depth of 20 km.
The overall report of local government said that there are no considerable injuries or great damage to infrastructure, which was caused by the quake.
At dawn of the same day, an earthquake with 6.4 magnitude also shook Puerto Williams port but it caused no damage to people and infrastructure.
Chile is located on the Ring of Fire Pacific Ocean, an area where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions usually happen.
In September, 2015, in this South America country there was an earthquake with 8.3 magnitude together with tsunami which killed 15 people and took away houses of more than 16000.
This had been the strongest earthquake in Chile since the one with 8.8 magnitude in February, 2010 which caused tsunami and deaths of over 500 people.
North Korea Can Use Hot Virtual Wallets to Circumvent U.S Sanctions.
North Korea can use virtual wallets to acquire U.S dollars.
North Korea is a country that has been hit hard by U.S sanctions in recent years, as the international community, and specifically the United States government attempts to push its agenda about certain policies.
These are especially in regard to human rights violations, and the North Korean regime's intimidating nuclear program.
Sanctions imposed on the North Korean government by the United States prohibit any person or company from undertaking trade with the nation.
The export of goods and services to North Korea as well as technology is also prohibited.
Only select non-governmental organizations are allowed to provide some limited services, send resources and transfer humanitarian technology to the state.
And as U.S sanctions bite, the hermit nation is scurrying to find more ways to circumvent them, and apparently relying more on cryptocurrencies.
There have been reports of this happening before and now, according to an investigation carried out by Lourdes Miranda, an independent financial crimes analyst, and Ross Delston, an American attorney, the North Korean government currently has advanced cryptocurrency resources to undermine the effectiveness of U.S sanctions.
By using major cryptocurrencies, the nation can pay for embargoed commodities from the outside world, including the United States.
Lourdes and Delston revealed this via a joint statement sent to The Asian Times.
According to the duo, the North Korean situation is particularly unique because the government is willing to provide funding and get its hands dirty in finding ways to get around the sanctions.
The two outlined several ways through which Pyongyang can achieve this through cryptocurrencies.
By launching its own range of cryptocurrencies and blockchain, for example, government actors can manipulate public ledger records and disguise the origin of coins, which is an important aspect of laundering crypto.
Integrating this aspect into its schemes, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) could use its own crypto hot wallets to transfer funds to the European market and finally into U.S.
exchanges to acquire U.S dollars.
Alternatively, the regime could start by obscuring the origin of crypto coins using multiple cryptocurrency tumbler services.
They mix digital coins from clients with currency from a wide range of sources.
Frequently shifting the coins and mixing them can break their linear pattern while maintaining the digital currency-type.
The complexities of undertaking this can differ significantly in relation to the circumstances.
DPRK agents could then utilize Russian platforms to open and fund virtual crypto wallets.
The wallets can be used to send coins to a Bulgarian platform and from there, transferred to a service based in Greece, for example.
At this stage, people who are able to provide qualifying Personally identifiable information (PII) can be hired to hold the funds or transfer them freely within EU based networks.
The digital currency can then enter the United States market.
Final steps would involve sending the coins to major cryptocurrency exchanges offering crypto for fiat services.
This is because most mixing services don't provide this, due to financial market regulatory requirements imposed by governments, which most would not wish to adhere to.
Acquiring fiat from major currency exchanges would enable the DPRK to get its hands on badly needed international currencies, allowing it to continue participating in international commerce.
This would provide limited buoyancy to its flagging economy.
Funding in Crypto for Top Secret Projects.
North Korea, reportedly earns upwards of $100 million in fiat currency each year converting crypto into cash.
The East Asian country has been observed to be taking part in numerous projects in countries such as India, the Philippines, and Malaysia.
As such, it must be getting funds for these projects in some way, since the country has been locked out of the SWIFT international money transfer system.
The best guess so far has been payments using cryptocurrencies, mainly because the projects are also top-secret.
Napping May Improve Learning, Memory.
March 16 is International Sleep Day.
And we should all celebrate the act of sleeping.
Studies have shown that a good night's rest helps us stay healthy, both mentally and physically.
And researchers say sleep is probably the best tool we have for memory and learning.
Michael Twery is director of the National Center on Sleep Disorders Research at America's National Institutes of Health.
Twery is an expert on the science of sleep and sleep disorders.
He told me that a good night's sleep helps to learn better.
Getting a good night's sleep is important for the learning and memory process.
It's important because it stores the training exercises and the learning exercises into our more permanent memory while we're sleeping 7-8 hours in bed.
And then the next morning when you wake up your mind is better prepared to act on that information.
But what about getting rest during the middle of the day? Short periods of sleep may help our brains work better, or so says a recent study on napping.
Past studies have shown that napping can help babies and young children learn better.
And napping can help brain performance in older adults.
Taking a nap may also help this group of people fights off age-related memory loss.
Driverless Robots for Transporting Food and More.
One of the latest trends in technology is the creation of personal robots to help people with day-to-day activities.
Some companies are testing driverless robots to bring food and other products directly to customers.
One such service is already operating on the streets of Washington, D.C.
Starship Technologies launched several self-driving robotic vehicles in the city earlier this year.
The six-wheeled electric machine sits about a half-meter high.
It has a box to carry small groceries or food products, up to nine kilograms in weight.
Users can order the robot service through an app – a software program -- on a smartphone.
The food or other things remain safe and secure inside the vehicle until the consumer orders the app to open the compartment.
The robotic vehicles move themselves along sidewalks, using camera and tracking technology to avoid people, cars and other objects.
Each robot has lights and a red flag on top to help people recognize them.
Someone is always following the robots' movements from a distance.
The company admits that someone might try to steal or block the robots.
But it adds that such an individual would be easy to catch because of the machine's cameras and tracking system.
The creators of Moby Mart say they have invented the world's first self-driving supermarket.
Moby Mart is about the size of a small bus.
It offers many products found in most convenience stores.
They include milk, lunch meats, fruits, and medicine.
The service has been tested in the city of Shanghai in recent months.
Designers say that when fully operational, Moby Mart will use electricity powered by the sun.
Facebook Now Rates Users on Trustworthiness.
Facebook is now rating users on how trustworthy they are in identifying and reporting real and false news.
The ratings system was first reported by The Washington Post.
A Post reporter interviewed Facebook product manager Tessa Lyons, who leads the company's efforts to fight misinformation.
Ms. Lyons told the newspaper the system was developed and put into place over the past year.
In January, Facebook announced a similar system to produce ratings for the trustworthiness of news sources.
At that time, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said those ratings would be based on information provided by Facebook users.
Zuckerberg said news sources receiving higher trustworthy ratings from the community would be prioritized in the social media service's News Feed.
The new ratings system is designed to predict how effective a user is at identifying and reporting false news stories.
Every user is given a rating between zero and one, the Post reports.
Ms. Lyons told the newspaper such a system is necessary because some users are incorrectly reporting whether a story is true or false.
It's not uncommon for people to tell us something is false simply because they disagree with the premise of a story or they're intentionally trying to target a particular publisher, Lyons said.
Young Americans Are Less Wealthy Than Their Parents.
The cost of living in the United States is going up, notes writer Alissa Quart.
As reported in the New York Post, Quart points to the costs of housing, education, health care and child care in particular.
At the same time, a new study found that half of Americans born in the 1980s are falling behind their parents economically.
The study is a project of researchers at Stanford University, Harvard University, and the University of California, Berkeley.
Their report is called The Fading American Dream.
Together, these findings show that many younger adults are experiencing downward mobility.
In other words, they are not doing as well, either socially or economically, as their parents were at the same age.
The idea of downward mobility is especially troubling for Americans, writes Robert Samuelson in The Washington Post.
He says most U.S citizens believe that, over time, the amount of money they earn will rise and life will get easier.
And for some, that belief has come true.
But among members of this generation, only about 60 percent of their children earned more money than they did.
And only 50 percent of children born in the following 10 years were earning more than their parents at the same age.
In other words, Americans' ease of living is going down.
In technical terms, the economists write, Absolute mobility has fallen sharply over the past 50 years.
Gmail allowed Android users to'undo' sent emails.
Users using Gmail app on Android have permission to access a handy feature that allows users toundo sent emails.
However, users will only have 10 seconds to undo the sent message before the handy feature is gone and the email is sent.
When users are in the process of sending a message, they will see the notification at the bottom of the screen that says Sending ..
in the left corner and Cancel in the opposite corner.
When the message is sent to the receiver and the users realise that they sent a wrong email or sent it to the wrong mail address, they will have a few seconds to undo the action.
Google has added the above mentioned useful feature in the latest Gmail update for users around the world.
Time, not material goods, 'raises happiness'.
Using money to free-up time is linked to increased happiness, a study says.
In an experiment, individuals reported greater happiness if they used £30 ($40) to save time - such as by paying for chores to be done - rather than spending the money on material goods.
Psychologists say stress over lack of time causes lower well-being and contributes to anxiety and insomnia.
Yet, they say even the very wealthy are often reluctant to pay people to do the jobs they dislike.
In a series of surveys we find that people who spend money to buy themselves more free time are happier - that is they have higher life satisfaction, said Dr Elizabeth Dunn, a psychologist professor at the University of British Columbia, Canada.
Rising incomes in many countries has led to a new phenomenon.
From Germany to the US, people report time famine, where they get stressed over the daily demands on their time.
Psychologists in the US, Canada and the Netherlands set out to test whether money can increase happiness levels by freeing up time.
More than 6,000 adults in the US, Canada, Denmark, and the Netherlands, including 800 millionaires, were asked questions about how much money they spent on buying time.
The researchers found that fewer than a third of individuals spent money to buy themselves time each month.
Those who did reported greater life satisfaction than the others.
The researchers then devised a two-week experiment among 60 working adults in Vancouver, Canada.
On one weekend, participants were asked to spend £30 ($40) on a purchase that would save them time.
They did things like buying lunches to be delivered to work, paying neighbourhood children to run errands for them, or paying for cleaning services.
On the other weekend, they were told to spend the windfall on material goods.
Material purchases included wine, clothes, and books.
The research, published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found time saving compared with material purchases increased happiness by reducing feelings of time stress.
Genes play a greater role in determining key personality traits like social skills and learning ability than the way we are brought up by our parents, researchers claimed.
The findings contradict the existing belief among psychologists that the environment we grow up in plays a larger role than genetics in shaping our personality.
Researchers from Edinburgh University studied more than 800 sets of identical and non-identical twins to learn whether genetics or upbringing has a greater effect on how successful people are in life.
Twins are useful in such studies because almost all twins share the same home environment as each other, but only identical twins share exactly the same genetics.
Participants were asked a series of questions about how they perceive themselves and others, such as are you influenced by people with strong opinions?
By applying their answers to a well-established scale of psychological scale, researchers could assess and categorise different personality traits for each person.
Writing in the Journal of Personality, the researchers found that identical twins were twice as likely as non-identical twins to share the same personality traits, suggesting that their DNA was having the greatest impact.
Genetics were most influential on people's sense of self-control and also affected their social and learning abilities and their sense of purpose.
Prof Timothy Bates, who led the study, said, Previously, the role of family and the environment around the home often dominated people's ideas about what affected psychological wellbeing.
However, this work highlights a much more powerful influence from genetics.
The study was focused on personality traits which contribute to our chances of success in life by dictating whether, for example, how determined we are to overcome challenges.
Most Americans believe their jobs are safe from the spread of automation and robotics, at least during their lifetimes, and only a handful says automation has cost them a job or loss of income.
Still, a survey by the Pew Research Center also found widespread anxiety about the general impact of technological change.
Three-quarters of Americans say it is at least somewhat realistic that robots and computers will eventually perform most of the jobs currently done by people.
Roughly the same proportion worry that such an outcome will have negative consequences, such as worsening inequality.
The public expects a number of different jobs and occupations to be replaced by technology in the coming decades, but few think their own job is heading in that direction, Aaron Smith, associate director at the Pew Research Center, said.
More than half of respondents expect that fast food workers, insurance claims processors and legal clerks will be mostly replaced by robots and computers during their lifetimes.
Nearly two-thirds think that most retailers will be fully automated in 20 years, with little or no human interaction between customers and employers.
Americans' relative optimism about their own jobs might be the more accurate assessment.
Many recent expert analyses are finding less dramatic impacts from automation than studies from several years ago that suggested up to half of jobs could be automated.
A report last week, issued by the education company Pearson, Oxford University, and the Nesta Foundation found that just one in five workers are in occupations that will shrink by 2030.
Camping Is Good for Your Brain.
On average, Americans spend about 10 hours a day in front of a computer or other electronic device and less than 30 minutes a day outdoors.
That is a claim made by David Strayer, a professor of psychology at the University of Utah.
In his 2017 TEDTalk, Strayer explained that all this time spent with technology is making our brains tired.
Using an electronic device – answering emails, listening to the news, looking at Facebook -- puts a lot of pressure on the prefrontal cortex, the front of the brain.
This area, Strayer explains, is important for critical thinking, problem-solving and decision-making.
So, it is important to give the brain a rest.
And being in nature, Strayer claims, helps refresh a brain that is tired from too much technology.
That is when time in the great outdoors and a camping trip can help.
Friends and family take time off and escape to nature for several days.
They take walks, climb, explore, swim, sleep, eat and play.
Camping may be just what a tech-tired brain needs.
Take Carl, for example.
He lives in West Virginia and enjoys camping.
He says that being outdoors makes him feel at ease.
It also prepares him for the work he must do.
Camping gives us a chance to get in touch with nature and it's a little less busy than our regular day-to-day life.
And it's very relaxing.
So, when you return to work on Monday generally you're in a better state of mind..
Why going through security at airports could make you ill.
Bug-laden planes are often blamed from making travellers ill, but a new study suggests that the germs may actually be closer to the ground.
Tests on plastic luggage trays at airport security found that half were harbouring at least one respiratory disease such as the common cold or influenza.
The communal trays, which often contain shoes and belts which are touched frequently but rarely washed, as well as detritus from pockets such as used tissues, were found to have more germs than even toilet areas.
The study was carried out by a team of experts from the University of Nottingham and the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare who swabbed a variety of surfaces at Helsinki-Vantaa airport in Finland during the winter of 2016 to find out how pandemics might spread.
Researchers say trays may be particularly bad for transferring disease because they are used by several hundred people a day, are non-porous which helps the viruses survive longer, and are 'typically seized with a wide palm surface area and strong grip.'.
Previous studies have found that one in five people become ill after flying and experts have advised that alcohol hand rub be made available before and after security.
Professor of Health Protection, Jonathan Van Tam, of Nottingham University's School of Medicine, said, This study supports the case for improved public awareness of how viral infections spread.
People can help to minimise contagion by hygienic hand washing and coughing into a handkerchief, tissue or sleeve at all times but especially in public places.
Walking High Above on Vietnam's 'Golden Bridge'.
In the mountains of central Vietnam, two huge hands lift a golden walkway high above the mountaintops.
It is as if the ground below has taken a human form and grown arms.
I feel like I'm walking on clouds, said Vuong Thuy Linh, a visitor from Hanoi.
It's so unique.
Many Vietnamese and foreign tourists have been to Cau Vang, or the Golden Bridge in Vietnam's Ba Na Hills, since it opened in June.
Most seemed very excited to see and experience a structure known for its unusual design.
The walkway sits at over 1,000 meters above sea level and extends over the treetops from the edge of a leafy cliff.
It offers visitors a clear, unrestricted view of the beautiful countryside below.
The bridge was a project of TA Landscape Architecture of Ho Chi Minh City.
It was designed to create the image of the giant hands of Gods, pulling a strip of gold out of the land, said Vu Viet Anh of TA Landscape Architecture.
It creates a walkway in the sky, among the foggy and fairy-like lands of Ba Na mountain, he told the Reuters news agency.
Anh noted that he had been surprised at the level of attention the company's design had received, both locally and internationally.
NASA detects signs of ice on the moon.
On August 20, NASA's astronomers showed signs of ice and water on the Moon's surface.
This is a study of researchers at the University of Hawaii and Brown University in conjunction with NASA's Ames Research Center.
According to the announcement on August 20, astronomers have found broken pieces of ice which scattered around the northern and southern poles of the moon.
Many years ago, scientists thought that there was water on the Moon, but there was no evidence before.
With the finding, scientists believe icebergs on the moon could provide a source of water for humans.
Based on NASA's latest data, the lowest temperature measured from the icebergs on the Moon's surface is -163oC and they are not affected by the Sun's intense heat.
A report by the National Academy of Science says that this is a remarkable milestone in mankind's quest to explore the Moon.
These icebergs seem to be a major resource that can assist the future expeditions.
The announcement was published in the National Academy of Science journal on August 20.
Smart classes, the education model for future.
By entering the code of class, students can access their personal accounts and study with their teacher via a digital textbook.
The textbook includes videos, sounds, images with the 360-degree view.
The prominent function of this solution is that teachers can compile and distribute directly the digital documents to the classrooms, can check the learning process of students at any time and answers of students are saved on the cloud so it is easy to see the results when they finish their tests.
For students, studying hours are always interesting.
To get used to the digital textbooks, students spend only two days because tablets are not unfamiliar to the students in cities.
How formula milk firms target mothers who can least afford it.
Formula milk companies are continuing to use aggressive, clandestine and often illegal methods to target mothers in the poorest parts of the world to encourage them to choose powdered milk over breastfeeding, a new investigation shows.
A Guardian/Save the Children investigation in some of the most deprived areas of the Philippines found that Nestlé and three other companies were offering doctors, midwives, and local health workers free trips to lavish conferences, meals, tickets to shows and the cinema and even gambling chips, earning their loyalty.
This is a clear violation of Philippine law.
Here, they reportedly hand out infant nutrition pamphlets to mothers, which appear to be medical advice but in fact recommend specific formula brands and sometimes have money-off coupons.
Hospital staff were also found to be recommending specific formula brands in lists of essential purchases handed to new mothers.
Targeted advertising on Facebook and partnerships with influential mummy bloggers means mothers are being exposed to more unregulated formula promotion than ever before.
At the same time, powerful lobby groups have been working to curtail government legislation regulating formula marketing and promotion, in the Philippines and across the world.
All companies have rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing.
Calling for conducting an investigation into the case of YouTube engaging children in watching promotional videos.
On April 9th, the US consumer advocacy organizations called the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate that Youtube's online video search service of Google, allowed the promotion targeting at children, which is an act that is allegedly considered as a violation of the US law.
According to these organizations, YouTube claims the site is only for users aged 13 or above, but in fact, it uses the personal information of children under 13 to deliver commercial ads to the children and help Google earn huge profits.
These organizations signed and filed a lawsuit against Google to the FTC, stating that Google had collected personal information about adolescents on YouTube including geolocation information, iOS operating system's unique device identifier (UDID) that these children were using and these children's mobile phone numbers to send them the clips of promotional videos on the Internet.
According to Josh Golin of the Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood, one of the groups that has filed a lawsuit against Google over the years, Google denied its responsibility for children and their families when it claimed that Youtube was not for children under the age of 13 while it still published video ads to entice children.
Too many lie-ins worse than too little sleep.
Having regular lie-ins is worse for the body than getting too little sleep, new research suggests.
Scientists have known for some time that not getting enough sleep increases the risk of a string of health complaints such as high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.
But a new review led by Keele University in Staffordshire, England, found that people who slept for an average of 10 hours a night were 30pc more likely to die early than those who only slept for seven hours.
Current recommendations suggest that adults should sleep for eight hours a night and although the precise benefits of sleep are still unknown, experts believe it gives the body a chance to repair cells and blood vessels, clear out waste and boost the immune system.
However, it was generally thought that too little sleep was far worse than too much.
But the new review of 74 studies involving three million people shows the opposite is true.
The research found that people with a sleep duration of 10 hours were 56pc more likely to suffer a stroke, at 49pc increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 44pc increase in coronary heart disease.
The results show that sleeping for longer than the recommended duration of seven or eight hours may be associated with a moderate degree of harm, compared to those who sleep for shorter durations.
It is unclear why oversleeping is bad for health.
Some studies have suggested that it changes the production of brain chemicals such as serotonin or dopamine which can lead to depression.
Albert Einstein's Theory of Happiness hit the record price.
Two notes about the happy life of the genius Albert Einstein were bought for $ 1.56 million in an auction organized by the auctioneer Winner's, which by far exceeds the estimation by $ 5,000 $ 8,000, and keeps the record price for a document auctioned in Israel.
According to Winner's, despite meaningless scientific value, the two notes reflected the philosophy of life of the great German scientist.
The auction briefly took place in 20 minutes.
The New owners of these two notes is an European citizenship, however, the name is requested to keep confidential.
Agreementabout fishing ban saves the North Pole.
This agreement allows scientists to carry out researches on the ecosystems of the Arctic Ocean and the impacts of climate change on the area.
Not only didthe agreement protecting an international sea area of 2.8 million km2come into force for countries which are contiguous with the North Pole but it also for China, Japan, Koreawhich usually have fishing boats working in that area.
In the past, thick ice layers and difficulties in locating the herd of fish used to partly limit the number of ships coming into the central sea.
But there is a serious decline in the layers of ice in the Arctic Ocean, with the fact thatabout 40% of the central sea of the North Pole becomes open sea, so ships can access more easily.
From the perspective of international law, all the nations can access this area.
Therefore, if the agreement didn't exist, fishing in the central North Pole wouldbe a mess despite its illegality.
With the above situation, scientists, groups for the environment as well as policy makers are afraid that the vulnerable ocean ecosystems can easily be affected here.
Erotic virtual assistant Vivi, designed to flirt with users, has been taken offline following criticism the avatar depicts women as sex objects.
WHO WAS VIVI?
Vivi was initially marketed as a built-in AI girlfriend back in March.
Then in October she was made to be a seductive secretary in an office.
Before she was taken offline almost all the online reviews were positive.
The virtual assistant, named Vivi could help users with certain tasks such as choosing a film or video game - but she could also flirt with users and could dance on request.
Dressed in revealing clothing, the assistant was in beta testing for a virtual reality headset when she was pulled.
Vivi could help users look at the company's content based on previous videos they have watched.
She could also tell the time, the weather, the time of TV shows and complete missing parts of a poem.
Users could touch Vivi who would giggle, be playful or pretend to be angry.
Shortly after, the company iQiyi, the streaming unit of Baidu, issued a swift apology for concerns it might have raised.
The Wall Street Journal contacted iQiyi to ask if the new avatar might encourage people to view women as sexual objects at work.
Just hours later the company removed the avatar.
The earlier version of the product is a beta-testing version designed to gather users feedback, the company said in a statement.
iQiyi has noticed the issue raised by media and already taken the product offline for further modification.
We'd like to make an apology for the concerns it might have raised.
The most important thing is she can perform sexy dances, with her enchanting figure, and only for you, one user wrote on Chinese Q&A website Zhihu.
One image posted on gaming review website Grapefruit Games, shows the boss touching Vivi's breast.
The doll was released at a time when awareness about sexual misconduct in the workplace was widespread.
Inappropriate sexual behaviour has been in the headlines following disclosures of high-profile business executives, media people and celebrities.
At the end of last month, Today show host Matt Lauer was fired for what NBC called inappropriate sexual behavior.
World's First AI-Citizen Sophia is Calling for Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia.
Hanson Robotics' Sophia is the world's first AI-powered robot to have been granted citizenship.
Now, Sophia is fighting for women's rights.
Last month, Sophia gained citizenship from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The move was seen as ironic at best, as a place so known for restricting women's rights would give more freedoms to a robot rather than its humans.
However, Hanson Robotics CEO David Hanson is turning Sophia's headline-making citizenship into something a bit bigger.
Sophia is now a women's rights advocate.
Sophia is a big advocate for women's rights, for rights of all human beings, Hanson Robotics CEO David Hanson said.
She has been reaching out about women's rights in Saudi Arabia and about rights for all human beings and all living beings on this planet.
When Sophia was initially granted her citizenship, women around the world immediately pointed out the disparity.
Sophia, a robot, was granted citizenship in a country that, until September, banned women from driving a car.

Amper Unveils the world's first album composed and produced by an AI.
A New Kind of Composer.
The release of Break Free, the first song in a new album called I AM AI of Taryn Southern on August 21, 2017 is the collaboration between the pop singer and a series of machine learning apps, including Amper.
Taryn Southern is the famous singer and digital storyteller in the music and entertainment industry.
Her channel has reached more than 500 million views with 450 thousand subscribers on YouTube.
Amper, an AI music composer, producer, and performer, is created by a team of professional musicians and technology experts.
Let's enjoy Break Free in the video below.
For her forthcoming album later this year, Taryn Southern gave Amper instructions, including the speed of the song, key signature tunes and preferred instruments, and AI then created a track based on these specifications.
According to Drew Silverstein, one of Amper's founders, Amper was specificially designed to cooperate with actual musicians.
He hoped human were going to cooperate with AI to create the future of music.
Ultimately, Amper has achieved breakthrough in AI-composed music revolution.
It means that AI is really doing most of the legwork that human are taking over.
Although IAMAI is the first album entirely composed and produced by an AI, it's not the first time an AI has performed its creativity in arts.
Southern's album is going to be distributed online through Stem platform which allows profits to be divided up among various creators.
In the near future, machines will not only write songs but also get paid from what they did.
A Hanoi resident banned from flying for a year for lifejacket violation.
The 53-year-old woman is a resident of Hanoi's Long Bien District banned from flying for a year after she refused to pay fines for using a lifejacket on a domestic flight without permission.
Her name has not been revealed.
According to the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) on Saturday, the woman will not be allowed on domestic and international flights until July 3 next year.
Also, she will be subject to strict security screening at airports for six months after the ban expires.
On a Vietnam Airlines flight from Quy Nhon Town in central Vietnam to Hanoi on June 2, the woman took out the lifejacket from under her seat and tore off its cover without permission or request from the cabin crew.
She was fined of VND2 million ($87) for her violation by The Northern Airport Authority.
However, the woman refused to pay it in spite of several reminders and warnings.
Officials said lifejackets on aircraft can only be used on the advice of flight attendants in case an emergency landing on water is needed.
Any act of removing a life jacket from the position without the flight attendant's request is a serious violation of aviation safety.
Nine more test positive for diphtheria.
Previously, a four-year-old boy in Gia Lai who died of diphtheria.
Nine of 24 people who'd come into contact with him in Gia Lai have tested positive for the disease on Sunday.
They are his parents and neighbors who are now being treated at the Gia Lai General Hospital and Children's Hospital.
These patients have shown symptoms of mild fever.
According to Mai Xuan Hai, director of Gia Lai's Department of Health, as many as 1,400 residents who belong to the Ba Na ethnic minority of Bong Hiot Village in Dak Doa District have been placed under quarantine to prevent the spread of diphtheria.
The latest diphtheria outbreak struck the Central Highlands region more than a month ago.
It has claimed the lives of three children.
In the Central Highlands region, Dak Nong Province has recorded Vietnam's highest to date with 16 cases of diphtheria in the latest outbreak while Kon Tum Province has reported eight cases.
Diphtheria is an infection caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheria bacterium.
The disease spreads through air and direct contact.
Nowadays, Diphtheria is can be prevented with vaccination.
However, the vaccination rate for diphtheria in the Central Highlands region was just 48-50 percent, making the region susceptible to repeated outbreaks, the General Department of Preventive Medicine under the Health Ministry said.
The symptoms of Diphtheria include fever, sore throat, swallowing difficulty, and white patches in the throat that could block the airway.
Complications include myocarditis, kidney problems, respiratory failure, inflammation of nerves, coma, and death.
Vietnam welcomes the lowest number of international tourists in the year.
With preventive measures to fight the Covid-19 infection still in force and its doors shut for foreign tourists, the number of international visitors to Vietnam in June — mainly foreign experts and technical employees who are working on projects in the country—is 8,800, the lowest in the past few years.
The number dropped over 61% month-on-month and a sharp 99% over the same period last year, according to the General Statistics Office.
As for the first half of this year, 3.7 million international tourists arrived in the country, down 55.8% against the same period last year.
Vietnam welcomed 2.72 million Asian tourists, which accounted for some 73% of the total but was still lower than the 2019 figure by some 58%.
Vietnam's tourist arrivals include China, South Korea, and Japan dropped 55%-63%, while the volume of Cambodian tourists soared as high as 105.9%.
Since the country has yet to resume international travel activities, the local tourism industry is still seeking ways to bounce back by exploiting the domestic segment and initially achieving positive results.
Pentagon concerned about Chinese military drills near Paracels.
The U.S Defense Department has criticized China's military exercises in the South China Sea, calling it a violation of China's commitments in maintaining stability in the region.
Conducting military exercises over disputed territory in the South China Sea is counterproductive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability, the department said Thursday.
China's actions will further destabilize the situation in the South China Sea, it said, adding that the exercises violate China's commitments under the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea to avoid activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace and stability.
Pentagon urged China to reduce its militarization and coercion of its neighbors in the waters.
The Maritime Safety Administration of China's Hainan Province had announced plans to hold military exercises near Vietnam's Paracel Islands from July 1-5.
Vietnam's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said Thursday the country has sent a diplomatic note to protest the illegal exercises, urging non-repetition of the incident.
Hang said the exercises violated Vietnam's sovereignty, complicating negotiations for a Code of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (COC) between China and ASEAN, and affecting peace.
Vietnam calls the waterway the East Sea.
Three banned from flying for altercations with cabin crew.
A woman and two men have been slapped with a one-year flight ban for assaulting flight attendants in two separate incidents.
The woman, 25, from the northern province of Thai Nguyen, is banned from flying until July 3 next year and is also subject to strict security screening at airports for six months after her ban expires, the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) said.
It said she was using a phone on a Vietjet flight from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh on June 19 when it was preparing to take off.
The head of the cabin crew requested her to turn off the phone, but she did not comply and instead threw the device at the person.
The flight crew decided to return to the apron and ask Noi Bai Airport security to deplane her and hand her over to the Northern Airport Authority.
She was let off after paying a VND4 million ($172) fine.
The two male passengers were similarly deplaned from a Vietnam Airlines flight leaving Hanoi for HCMC on May 21 after getting into an altercation with a flight attendant and other passengers.
One of them, 46, cursed, insulted, and threatened them.
He had been arguing with two other passengers after discovering their luggage was placed above his seat, and verbally assaulted a flight attendant who sought to mediate.
This delayed take-off by an hour and he was later deplaned.
Another passenger, 49, who supported the man's abusive behavior, was also considered to have violated public order.
The Northern Airport Authority fined the two a total of VND10 million ($429).
Vietnamese lychees make it to Singapore supermarket shelves.
Vietnamese lychees, exported to Japan for the first time last month, are now being sold by Singapore's largest retail chain, FairPrice.
FairPrice, which accounts for a 70 percent market share, is selling lychees sourced from the northern Bac Giang Province for SGD5 ($3.6) per kilogram, according to the Vietnam Trade Office in that country.
Fifty tons have been shipped so far, half of the volume contracted for export this year.
Some outlets ran out of stock within two weeks, the trade office said.
Vietnam has been working to export the fruit to Singapore since 2018, but in the last two years lychees were only sold in outdoor markets without proper preservation, causing them to rot quickly and discouraging importers.
In future supply could be a challenge.
Singapore buys the same lychees that are grown for exporting to Japan, and there would not be enough for it, and when the latter increases its demand.
Vietnamese producers also need to improve packaging and preservation since there are many rotten fruits when shipments arrive in Singapore, the trade office said, adding this could be a challenge in the future.
Vietnam last month exported fresh lychees to Japan after five years of negotiations and preparations to meet quality standards.
An estimated 200 tons will be shipped there this year.
Bac Giang, a lychee growing hub, is set to harvest 700 tons of lychees this year, and also eyes exports to the U.S and Australia.
Surveillance activities on Vietnamese seas must have Vietnam's permission.
All surveillance activities on Vietnamese seas need Vietnam's express permission, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang asserted Thursday.
She was responding to an inquiry regarding China's survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 4 entering Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) last month.
All surveillance and scientific research activities on Vietnamese sea areas in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) must be allowed by Vietnam as stated by the convention.
She said, Respecting the sovereignty, sovereignty rights and jurisdiction rights of countries and UNCLOS regulations has important meaning for the maintenance of peace, stability, security, cooperation and development on the East Sea, the region and the world.
The East Sea is known internationally as the South China Sea.
Filipino news website Benar News reported on June 16, using two separate vessel-tracking tools, that China's survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 4 entered Vietnam's EEZ from June 14-16.
It was detected within 200 nautical miles off Vietnam's coast and roughly 182 nautical miles from Vietnam's Phu Quy Island, the paper said.
In April, Reuters also reported that Chinese survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8, used for offshore seismic surveys, had appeared at 158 km (98 miles) off Vietnam's coast, within Vietnam's EEZ.
It was the same vessel that had violated Vietnam's EEZ and the continental shelf of Vietnam near the Vanguard Bank, occupying the area for many weeks last year.
At the Thursday press meet, Hang also said Vietnam has sent a diplomatic note to protest China's performing military exercises near Paracel Islands this week.
Vietnam has repeatedly condemned China's illegal actions in the East Sea, asserting it has full legal basis and historical evidence to affirm its sovereignty over the Truong Sa (Spratly) and Huong Sa (Paracel) Islands in accordance with international law.
It has also stressed that all activities conducted by any party near either island without prior consent from Vietnam hold no value.
Government to sell its shares in Vietnam's largest brewer.
The government plans to sell its 36 percent stake in the country's largest brewer, Sabeco, this year.
The Saigon Beer Alcohol Beverage Corp (Sabeco) is one of 139 enterprises in a new list in which the government's stakes will be sold by sovereign fund State Capital Investment Corporation.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) has been instructed to transfer the government's stakes in these enterprises to the SCIC by August 31.
The government had sold a 53.59 percent stake in Sabeco to ThaiBev for over $5 billion in 2017.
At the end of 2019, the maker of Saigon Beer had assets estimated at VND 26.96 trillion ($1.2 billion) and owner's equity of VND20.07 trillion ($870 million).
Sabeco recently scaled down its revenue target for this year by 37 percent to VND23.8 trillion ($1 billion) and post-tax profit target by 39 percent to VND3.2 trillion ($138 million), the lowest in six years.
WB offers aid for higher education, urban development in Vietnam.
On June 30, the World Bank's (WB) board of executive directors approved the financing of two projects —to help build a climate-resilient city in the Mekong Delta and improve the quality of Vietnam's three national universities—at US$422 million.
The Vietnam University Development Project, financed through credit worth US$295 million, will improve teaching and research capacity at the Vietnam National University-Hanoi, the Vietnam National University-HCMC and the University of Danang, the WB said in a statement.
Through investments in modern infrastructure, cutting-edge equipment and knowledge transfer, it will help transform the universities into regionally competitive institutions with advanced teaching and research capabilities.
Meanwhile, the Vinh Long City Urban Development and Enhanced Climate Resilience Project in Vinh Long Province, financed through credit worth US$127 million, will improve access to infrastructure and connectivity and reduce the risk of floods in Vinh Long City's urban.
Investing in human capital and urban development are among the top priorities of the World Bank in Vietnam, noted Ousmane Dione, the World Bank country director for Vietnam.
Dione stressed that the two projects will help accelerate real progress in areas critical to sustainable growth in Vietnam, skilled workers and more efficient and greener infrastructure.
The university development project aims to address certain key challenges faced by the higher education system.
With the new funding, university infrastructure, once overcrowded and obsolete, will be upgraded to become modern, integrated, green and digital ready.
The project, implemented in the three flagship universities, is also expected to enhance institutional capacity and to adopt new digital technology, in line with the national goals identified in the recently amended law on higher education and the upcoming 10-year higher education strategy.
The Vinh Long City development project will invest in resilient infrastructure and the improved disaster risk management of Vinh Long City – a secondary city strategically located along the economic corridor that connects Ho Chi Minh City to the Mekong Delta.
The project will help improve access to basic services such as drainage, wastewater collection and treatment and other green infrastructure and reduce the flooding risk that 60% of the city's population faces.
It will also develop three strategic roads that will serve as critical links in the city's road network.
The credit for the two projects has been provided by the International Development Association.
Picture of newborn clutching IUD goes viral.
An image of a baby boy in northern Hai Phong City holding an intrauterine device has attracted astounding online attention.
The picture, taken by doctors at Hai Phong International Hospital on Tuesday, showed a newborn with his eyes closed, holding an intrauterine device (IUD).
Upon its upload to the hospital's own social network, the image received over 3,000 likes alongside more than 7,000 comments and shares.
When the boy was born, the device came out with him and he grabbed it, said Tran Viet Phuong, head of the hospital's second obstetrics department.
After delivery, I thought him holding the device was interesting, so I took a picture.
I never thought it would receive so much attention, Phuong said.
Doctors said his 34-year-old mother had given birth twice before.
Two years prior, she inserted the intrauterine device into her uterus at a local hospital.
She later discovered that a five-week-old fetus had formed in her womb, at the location of the device.
She gave birth to the healthy baby boy, who weighs 3.2 kg, on Tuesday morning.
Both mother and child are being monitored at the hospital.
An intrauterine device works as a birth control implement by not allowing sperm to fertilize an egg.
But it does not have a 100 percent success rate, said Phuong.
Upon its insertion, the device might have been moved from its original position and thus was no longer effective, he added.
Vietnam Covid-19 vaccine to complete in, pharma firm.
Vietnam's trial Covid-19 vaccine is expected to be ready in October next year after human trials, said the chairman of a state-owned pharmaceutical firm Wednesday.
Development of the vaccine has shown very positive progress, said Do Tuan Dat, director of developer Vaccine and Biological Production No 1 (Vabiotech).
Last week, the treatment had proven highly immunogenic when tested on 50 mice based on analyses of their serum samples.
Testing on mice is an important step in preparing vaccines for human trials, where researchers would be looking for an immune response after administration, Dat said.
It would normally take three to five years to produce a good trial vaccine, and five to 10 years to complete.
But research and production of the Covid-19 vaccine might be shortened.
Maybe in another 9-12 months, there would be a vaccine qualified to be tested on humans.
To boost vaccine development, two Vabiotech employees traveled to the U.K for research purposes from February to March.
Their greatest challenge was to create the most stable antigens suitable to trigger an immune response in humans, Dat said.
The exact time for Vietnam's Covid-19 vaccine to go public has not been determined.
Dat said the firm is trying to shorten research and production so the vaccine would be completed in October next year.
Researchers are also working on the treatment so it could be immunogenic after two doses.
The potential vaccine was first tested on 50 mice in May, though the project had commenced in February.
Success in producing antibody responses in mice has moved the project's first phase forward by two months, said Mac Van Trong, a member of the Vabiotech research team.
The project was funded VND 8 billion ($345,216), including sponsorship from conglomerate Vingroup.
Hundreds of Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being carried out worldwide, with over a dozen vaccines being tested on humans.
Vietnam has recorded 355 Covid-19 infectionss so far, with 20 active cases left and no deaths.
No community transmission has been recorded in over two months.
Vietnam to test Covid-19 vaccine on humans.
The first human trial of a Covid-19 vaccine produced by VABIOTECH Company in Vietnam is expected to begin in early 2021, said Do Tuan Dat, director of the company.
The Hanoi City-based firm will test the vaccine on animals one more time in the next nine months before starting the first trial on humans, Dat told Tuoi Tre newspaper.
The developers of the VABIOTEC vaccine in coordination with the UK's Bristol University had been conducting research to develop the Covid-19 vaccine since February this year, after the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology managed to culture and isolate the novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
The research on the vaccine was facilitated to prepare for the testing stage.
To date, two trials of the vaccine have been carried out on mice.
According to Dang Duc Anh, head of NIHE, the vaccine that was injected into four of the eight batches of mice in late April was evaluated to prove successful.
Lifetime employment for public employees abolished from today.
The amended and supplemented Law on Cadres and Civil Servants and the revised Law on Public Employees will take effect from today, July 1, with the lifetime employment policy for State employees eliminated.
Under the amended laws, public employees who were recruited today, July 1, will sign labor contracts with a definite term instead of the previous indefinite one.
The term of labor contracts extends up to five years, up two years against the previous term, Thanh Nien newspaper reported.
Besides this, in line with the amended laws, the signing of indefinite-term labor contracts will remain as is for those who were recruited prior to July 1, 2020, civil servants being moved to public employee positions and public employees who are working in extremely difficult socio-economic conditions.
As for public employees who were employed before July 1 but were yet to sign an indefinite-term contract, they are entitled to sign contracts with an indefinite term after finishing their contracts in line with the revised laws.
To guarantee the benefits of public employees signing definite-term labor contracts, the amended laws also regulate that leaders of State units or organizations must continue to sign or terminate a labor contract with employees 60 days prior to the expiration date of the contract.
South China Sea not China's maritime empire, US.
U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Sunday that China cannot be allowed to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire.
The United States welcomes ASEAN leaders' insistence that South China Sea disputes be resolved in line with international law, including UNCLOS.
China cannot be allowed to treat the SCS as its maritime empire.
We will have more to say on this topic soon, the tweet read.
The UNCLOS refers to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The South China Sea is known in Vietnam as the East Sea.
Mr. Pompeo also included a link to the ASEAN Leaders' Vision Statement on a Cohesive And Responsive ASEAN, Rising Above Challenges And Sustaining Growth, which was passed by ASEAN leaders at the 36th ASEAN Summit in Hanoi on Friday.
Previously, on June 2, Pompeo had also tweeted a diplomatic note sent by U.S.
Ambassador Kelly Craft to the U.N in response to the one sent by the Permanent Mission of China to the U.N on December 12.
China was responding to Malaysia's submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf.
12 Pakistani pilots fly for Vietjet, Jetstar Pacific.
Among the 27 Pakistani pilots in Vietnam who have been suspended over fake license concerns, 11 are working for local low-cost carrier Vietjet and 1 for Jetstar Pacific.
The remaining Pakistani pilots had their contracts expired or were furloughed and returned home amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) last night, June 28, released information about the 27 Pakistani pilots, after Pakistan's aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan revealed on June 24 that 262 Pakistani pilots have fake licenses.
He said that these pilots did not take the exam themselves and paid someone else to sit it on their behalf.
Specifically, Vietnam earlier employed a total of 27 Pakistani pilots that were granted flight permits by CAAV.
Of them, six worked for national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, 17 flying for Vietjet, and four for Jetstar.
Due to the impact of Covid-19, only 12 Pakistani pilots remain active in Vietnam, said CAAV.
A Vietjet representative on Sunday afternoon affirmed that none of its Pakistani pilots or those with licenses granted by Pakistan are on duty.
Vietjet is employing 823 pilots.
Of them, 413 out of 431 captains are experienced pilots achieving over 5,000 flight hours each.
Previously, Bamboo Airlways and the Vietnam Airlines Group, including Vietnam Airlines, Jetstar Pacific, and VASCO, asserted on the day that they are not employing Pakistani pilots or those using Pakistan-issued licenses.
Specifically, Vietnam Airlines and VASCO's staff consists of 850 Vietnamese pilots and 106 foreign pilots.
The percentage of local pilots account for almost 90% of the total.
As for Jetstar Pacific, its staff is comprised of 60 Vietnamese pilots and 145 foreign pilots.
Also, Bamboo Airways stated that it is currently not employing any Pakistani pilots or those using licenses, certifications granted by the Pakistani aviation authority.
Most of the Bamboo Airways foreign pilots are chiefly from the UK, Germany, France, the U.S., and Brazil.
According to CAAV, the issuance of flight permits for the 27 Pakistani pilots has complied with Vietnam's flight safety regulations and the Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago Convention.
During the time working for Vietnamese carriers, no Pakistani pilots were associated with any flight incidents.
However, CAAV has requested all local airlines to temporarily suspend Pakistani pilots until further notice.
Vietnam rail operators plan to launch of freight trains to Europe.
Vietnam Railways Corporation plans to operate freight trains to China and onward to third countries such as Russia and others in Europe this year.
In its 2020 plans, the company seeks to step up the utilization of international freight transport with plans to ship fruits and aquaculture products directly from southern provinces to China using refrigerated containers.
The plan was mooted since the company's revenues are expected to be severely impacted by a sharp decline in passenger numbers this year.
It plans to reduce the number of trains since demand is down due to the Covid-19 pandemic but increases the number of halts by long-distance passenger trains and the number of north-south freight trains.
Vietnam Railways expects to suffer a net loss of VND1.39 trillion ($60 million) this year.
It said in 2016-19 its business had been hit by five factors, including fierce competition with low-cost airlines and high-speed expressway buses in terms of fares and quality of service and increasing costs of materials, water, and electricity.
It admitted its competitiveness is low, resulting in fewer opportunities for growth.
A lack of funding for upgrading infrastructure has also affected train services and business performance.
Over the next five years it would study short and medium-distance options instead of long-distance routes and cut down on low-efficiency trains, it said.
Depending on demand, it could start new services to smaller towns and collaborate with cities and provinces to transport foreign tourists.
British pilot could fly home next month.
Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient, who has been hospitalized for more than three months in HCMC, could leave for Scotland next month.
Stephen Cameron, the 43-year-old pilot who staged a remarkable recovery after being comatose for more than two months, could go home on a repatriation flight set to depart from Hanoi on July 12 if he is well enough, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Truong Son said.
Hopefully the patient can walk in the next 10 days and will be strong enough to fly home, Son said Monday.
When he leaves, a medical team will accompany him.
Son said the U.K Embassy has sent a document to the Covid-19 treatment sub-committee under the ministry, suggesting that Vietnamese experts and authorities assess whether Patient 91 was healthy enough to return to his native Scotland on a long flight.
The embassy's proposal is for the British pilot to be taken on the July 12 Vietnam Airlines flight that is set to fly from Hanoi to the U.K for bringing back stranded Vietnamese citizens.
The British embassy has said the patient's insurance company will cover all the costs for him to leave Vietnam with the assistance of Vietnamese health specialists.
Local reports have said that leading Vietnamese specialists will have to hold another national consultation to see if the British pilot, who was to work for the national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, is healthy enough to be discharged from the hospital and endure a long flight back to the U.K.
Cameron, known commonly as Patient 91, has been hospitalized since he was confirmed Covid-19 positive on March 18.
His fate has received unprecedented national and global attention as the strongest symbol of Vietnam's success in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.
A country of 96 million people that shares a long border with China, where the novel coronavirus is said to have originated, has recorded no Covid-19 deaths thus far.
The patient is currently in good health and can eat without any medical intervention.
His limb muscle strength and respiratory functions have returned.
He can breathe, sit up, and walk a few steps on his own with the aid of a supporting frame.
The insurance company recently paid VND3.5 billion ($151,000) for the patient's medical bill at the Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Tropical Diseases where he underwent treatment from March 18 to May 22 and was cured of Covid-19.
Vietnam, which has recorded 355 Covid-19 infections so far, has gone 72 days without community transmission of the virus.
Noi Bai, TSN runway upgrades set for July.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam has approved a plan to shut the runways and taxiways at HCMC's Tan Son Nhat airport and Hanoi's Noi Bai airport for repair and upgrade starting from July 1, as part of a major project to rehabilitate and upgrade the runways and taxiways of the two international airports.
At Tan Son Nhat airport, runway 25R/07L and taxiways E1, NS1, W4 and W6 will be closed from July 1 until the end of the year for maintenance.
During this period, aircraft will take off and land on runway 25L / 07R.
The HCMC-based airport was asked to team up with the relevant agencies to ensure safety and security and maintain operations at the airport during the execution of the project.
Regarding Noi Bai airport, runways 11L/29R and 11R/29L will be shut one at a time for the upgrade until the end of the year to avoid affecting operations at the airport.
To Tu Ha, deputy director of Noi Bai airport, said the flight frequency would drop as planes will take off and land on the same runway during the upgrade.
Many flights scheduled for peak hours would be shifted to less busy hours, with the total number of daily flights at the Hanoi-based airport remaining unchanged.
Ha advised passengers to stay updated on the latest information regarding their flight status and come to the airport at least two hours ahead of departure.
The Transport Ministry said that starting work on the two projects in early July is essential since the flight frequency at the two airports is low as there are almost no international flights due to Covid-19.
When the pandemic is over, the demand for international travel will surge, making the closure of the runways more difficult.
Since 2017, the two airports have been suffering from overloading and receiving many more modern aircraft with a huge capacity.
As a result, their runways and taxiways have deteriorated.
AEON promotes Vietnamese agricultural products.
The first batch of fresh Vietnamese lychees exported to Japan is being sold at 250 AEON General Merchandise Stores & Supermarkets and AEON Style stores across Japan.
The fresh lychees were shipped by air from the end of May to the end of June without freezing to ensure the quality and taste of the product remain intact.
AEON's customers in Japan can enjoy the fruit during the right season at the freshest taste.
The Covid-19 pandemic had a significant effect on imports and exports but AEON strived to promptly purchase and export of Vietnamese lychees.
Besides lychees, many other special Vietnamese agricultural products such as mangoes, dragon fruits and coffee are being exported and sold across AEON's supermarkets in Japan since 2015.
Since December 2019 after the import restriction on Vietnam's fruits was lifted, the first batches of fresh Vietnamese lychees have been exported to Japan.
AEON is the first retailer to sell this fruit to Japanese consumers.
The successful export and distribution of Vietnamese agricultural products across AEON's retail system in Japan are the result of the efforts of companies under the AEON Group in Vietnam.
AEON has cooperated with the Ministry of Industry and Trade to organize activities in support of Vietnamese suppliers to improve the quality of domestic products exported to foreign markets, especially Japan.
In 2017, the total export turnover of Vietnamese products through the AEON system reached some US$250 million, in 2018, it reached US$330 million, in 2019, US$370 million and in 2020, it aims to reach US$450 million.
Fresh outbreak of ASF leaves over 5,800 pigs culled.
The recurrence of the African swine fever (ASF) in many localities nationwide has led to the culling of 5,856 affected pigs as of June 28, according to a Department of Animal Health official.
The disease has been reported in 143 communes of 14 provinces, with one commune being newly hit, stated Tran Thi Thu Phuong, chief of the Department's Division of International Cooperation and Communication.
To date, ASF outbreaks have occurred in 255 communes of 20 provinces and cities across the country for less than 30 days.
In the northern province of Lai Chau, the highly contagious disease, which has spread to four of the seven communes and wards of Lai Chau City, led to 100 sick pigs being killed.
The province has taken drastic measures to fight ASF, but it is at risk of facing a wider spread as the disease had earlier struck 93 of its 108 communes and wards, noted Nguyen Anh Hung, head of the Lai Chau Animal Health Division.
In Cao Bang, the ASF recurrence had killed 600 pigs by June 24, with 138 farming households in nine of the 10 districts and towns affected.
The scattered outbreaks have left this northern upland province struggling to curb the spread of the disease.
Amid the fresh outbreak of the fatal disease, the Department of Animal Health has urged localities to intensify measures to prevent and control its spread.
CAAV proposes reopening international air routes in late July.
In a report sent to the Ministry of Transport last weekend, the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) proposed restarting certain international commercial flights to transport passengers into Vietnam in late July via the travel bubble or travel corridor models.
CAAV stressed that the model can be expanded to countries and territories that have gone 30 days without any community transmission of Covid-19.
Under the travel bubble model, participating countries will allow the entry of their citizens and foreigners who are businesspeople, technical experts, students and others holding residence permits, according to CAAV.
Arriving passengers will be mandatorily quarantined for 14 days.
However, the authority proposed not denying entry to tourists who meet the requirements of Covid-19 infection prevention, VnExpress news site reported.
Besides this, Vietnam should not accept passengers who transit in other countries before entering Vietnam.
As such, the passengers must have stayed in partner countries and territories for at least 30 consecutive days before flying to Vietnam.
In addition, the passengers will be required to present negative Covid-19 test results which need to be taken three days before boarding.
The passengers will also take a quick Covid-19 test on arrival at local airports and airlines will cover the cost of the tests.
To make the plan a reality, the CAAV proposed that the Ministry of Transport report it to the prime minister and ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to work with foreign affairs agencies to restart regular international flights.
Mr. Dinh Viet Thang, head of the CAAV, said that while some airlines in Taiwan had proposed allowing them to reopen some air routes to Vietnam, the local air carriers were prepared to resume international flights.
Coach called up 28 players for SEA Games football.
Coach Park Hang-seo has called up 28 players including some new faces for next year's SEA Games to be hosted by Vietnam.
The Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) announced the list on Monday, and the team will gather on Wednesday.
Notably, there are no players from V.League champions Hanoi FC since the capital-based club are facing an injury crisis and asked to retain their rising young players like Bui Hoang Viet Anh and Le Xuan Tu until the V. League 1 ends.
Some other clubs too do not want to release their players amid the V. League 1 schedule.
Those called up include Nguyen Danh Trung (Viettel FC), Mai Sy Hoang, Le Thanh Lam (Song Lam Nghe An) and five players from Hoang Anh Gia Lai for the first time.
Among the familiar faces is Tran Bao Toan, who was selected by Park for the final squad list of the U23 team in the AFC U23 Championship earlier this year, where Vietnam was eliminated from the group stage.
Becamex Binh Duong had three players selected.
Hong Linh Ha Tinh, the club with the youngest average age (24.4), HCMC MC and Than Quang Ninh each contributed two.
The team will have a short training camp from July 1 to 3 for Park to evaluate their form.
China researchers discover new swine flu with 'pandemic potential'.
(CNN)Chinese researchers have discovered a new type of swine flu that can infect humans and has the potential to cause a future pandemic, according to a study released on Monday, though scientists have cautioned that the virus does not pose an immediate global health threat.
The disease, which researchers called the G4 virus, is genetically descended from the H1N1 swine flu that caused a pandemic in 2009.
But Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University's public health school, warned the public not to freak out.
Chinese researchers based at several institutions, including Shandong Agricultural University and the Chinese National Influenza Center, discovered the G4 virus during a pig surveillance program.
From 2011 to 2018, they collected more than 30,000 nasal swab samples from pigs in slaughterhouses and veterinary teaching hospitals across 10 Chinese provinces.
From these samples, researchers identified 179 swine influenza viruses -- but not all of them posed a concern.
Further tests showed that G4 can infect humans by binding to our cells and receptors, and it can replicate quickly inside our airway cells.
And though G4 holds H1N1 genes, people who have received seasonal flu vaccines won't have any immunity.
G4 already appears to have infected humans in China.
In Hebei and Shandong provinces, both places with high pig numbers, more than 10% of swine workers on pig farms and 4.4% of the general population tested positive in a survey from 2016 to 2018.
There is no evidence yet that G4 could spread from person to person -- perhaps the most promising sign so far, said Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington.
However, researchers warn in the paper that the virus was on the rise among pig populations, and could pose a serious threat to human health if not carefully monitored.
Transmission of the virus from pig to human could lead to severe infection and even death, said the study, which called for greater control of the virus' spread within pig populations.
India bans TikTok as tensions with China escalate.
While the Indian government's statement did not mention China by name, the ban comes as military tensions between the two countries continue to escalate following deadly border clashes earlier this month that left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead.
Many Indians have called for a boycott of Chinese goods and services, particularly from China's dominant tech industry.
Other popular Chinese apps on the list include the video game Clash of Kings, messaging app WeChat, social network Weibo, and photo app CamScanner.
TikTok, the hugely popular video platform owned by Chinese tech giant Bytedance, has an estimated 120 million users in India, making the country one of its biggest markets.
China dominates India's massive internet market — the world's second-largest, with close to 600 million users — both in hardware and software.
Chinese companies such as Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus account for more than half of India's smartphone market, according to industry figures, and Chinese tech giants Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) are major investors in some of the country's most valuable startups.
Nonetheless, the ban will be a blow to the Chinese app industry that loses a strong, according to research firm Canalys.
Beijing approves experimental Covid-19 vaccine for use in Chinese military.
The Chinese government has approved the use of an experimental Covid-19 vaccine for the country's military -- the latest step in a global race to stop the deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The vaccine, known as Ad5-nCoV, was jointly-developed by the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology -- part of the Chinese government's Academy of Military Medical Sciences -- and vaccine company CanSino Biologics.
In a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, CanSino announced that China's Central Military Commission had given the vaccine a military specially-needed drug approval on June 25.
The special permission will last for one year and will only apply to military personnel.
China has repeatedly insisted that its military has remained unaffected by the pandemic, with officials claiming that the People's Liberation Army (PLA), has not recorded a single coronavirus case.
US observers, however, have cast doubt on the claims, noting that the PLA is among the world's largest standing armies, making it statistically unlikely that its personnel has not been exposed to the virus.
Neither the Chinese government nor CanSino have said how broadly the vaccine will be distributed, which units were be selected or whether it will be mandatory or voluntary for personnel.
According to a CanSino statement, clinical trials of the new vaccine have shown a good safety profile with initial results indicating that Ad5-nCoV had potential to prevent diseases caused by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus strain that causes Covid-19.
CanSino had previously announced in May that the Canadian government was allowing human trials of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine.
This vaccine candidate holds great promise, Iain Stewart, president of the National Research Council of Canada, said in a statement at the time.
UAE and China launch Phase 3 clinical trial in humans for Covid-19 vaccine.
No vaccine has been approved yet for commercial release.
Currently, at least 17 vaccines are in clinical evaluation around the world, according to the World Health Organization, eight of which are being developed in China.
According to the statement from CanSino, the first and second phases of their Ad5-nCoV vaccine trials have already been completed.
A woman faces criminal charges after death of abandoned baby.
Hanoi police on Tuesday arrested a woman for abandoning her newborn boy, who later died.
Pham Thi Thanh, 31, is being investigated for murdering or abandoning a newborn child, police said, a day after her son, abandoned right after birth near a manhole in Son Tay Town, died of septic shock following 21 days of intensive care at Hanoi's Saint Paul Hospital.
She could receive a penalty of up to two years' community service or between three months and two years' imprisonment, according to Vietnam's Penal Code.
Thanh told police she caught a bus from downtown Hanoi to Son Tay on June 6.
Around 11 p.m.
the same day, she fell into labor, walked alone to a vegetable field next to a temple in Thanh My Commune, and gave birth to a boy.
She said she was unable to raise the child, so she abandoned the boy near a deserted manhole behind the temple.
Two days later, local residents found the naked boy and took him to the Saint Paul Hospital for emergency care.
Doctors treated the baby with antibiotics, who responded well to treatment.
Hospital subsequently named him Nguyen Van An, which means peace and safety, hoping he would soon recover.
However, his condition soon deteriorated due to a serious blood infection.
Doctors worked closely with experts from the National Pediatrics Hospital, but were unable to save the child.
Thanh told the police she had had sex with many men recently and didn't know who the boy's father was.
Nghe An battles massive forest fire.
The fire, which broke out Friday night in the north-central province's Dien Chau District, raged throughout Saturday night, engulfing a large area of 30-year-old pine trees in Dien Loi Commune.
Strong winds made it difficult to approach the fire.
For safety reasons, authorities have instructed firefighting forces, including soldiers, police officers and locals, to retreat from big fire areas and focus on creating firebreaks to prevent the flames from reaching residential areas and new forest patches.
As of 8 a.m Sunday, hundreds of personnel were still putting out small fires and being stationed in different locations to monitor the fire and prevent it from flaring up again.
While the district is yet to calculate the damage inflicted by the fire, around 200 ha of pine and acacia forest patches have been incinerated throughout over the last two days.
The blaze was sparked in a pine forest in Yen Thanh District's Son Thanh Commune.
High temperatures of up to 40 Celsius degree, along with the foehn effect (the warming and drying of air on the lee side of a mountain range), caused it to grow quickly, creating high columns of smoke and rendering firefighting efforts futile.
The flames then spread to Dien Chau District's Dien Phu Commune and Nghi Loc District's Nghi Van Commune.
Central Vietnam has been experiencing several heat waves over the past month.
The latest one began June 18 with the mercury soaring up to 41 Celsius degree.
71 H'Mong families bear quarantine rigors after diphtheria outbreak.
Life has changed drastically for the community since their living area in Dak Nong Province was declared a quarantine zone following the death of a nine-year-old girl earlier this month and a dozen others getting infected.
The quarantine zone, located in Dak Nong's Quang Hoa Commune, Dak Glong District, has two checkpoints, situated on both ends of a residential area where 71 families reside.
Each checkpoint has two militia members and a police officer.
They rest and have their meals at the checkpoints or in the local cultural center.
All residents in the area belong to the H'mong ethnic minority, said Hoang Van Hau, a militia member.
They typically go to work or farm dozens of kilometers away, he added.
Now, anyone wanting to get out of the quarantine zone must have legitimate reasons and put it in writing.
An unpaved road in Quang Hoa Commune wears a deserted look with no one venturing outdoors.
Local residents here have been quarantined for a week or so.
Diphtheria is a highly contagious bacterial infection that spreads through either the air or direct contact.
Symptoms include fever, sore throat, swallowing difficulty, and the development of white patches in the throat, which could block the airway.
Possible complications include myocarditis, kidney problems, respiratory failure, inflammation of nerves, coma, and death.
Medical workers take samples from those who are suspected to have been in contact with infected cases.
As of Sunday morning, medical workers in Dak Nong had taken 572 samples to be tested for diphtheria in total.
Over 1,300 people are undergoing preventive treatment.
Dak Nong has so far recorded 12 diphtheria cases.
All outbreak areas, including Krong No District's Dak Sor Commune and Dak Glong District's Dak R'mang Commune and Quang Hoa Commune, each one dozens of kilometers apart, have now been quarantined.
The diphtheria vaccination rate in Dak Nong is only around 52-65 percent, said Dang Thanh, director of the provincial Center for Disease Control.
He said the H'Mong community not being cooperative about vaccination.
The province vaccinated around 4,800 residents of Quang Hoa, aged 7-40, against diphtheria and tetanus on Saturday.
Diphtheria vaccination is part of Vietnam's national immunization program but the regimen is not followed strictly in several areas for various reasons.
Vietnam suspends 27 Pakistani pilots for license verification.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has suspended 27 Pakistani pilots flying for Vietnamese carriers to check their licenses' authenticity, following the Pakistani aviation authority's investigation revealing that over 250 Pakistani pilots have fake licenses.
The suspended pilots' licenses were granted by the Pakistani aviation authority.
CAAV is waiting for the final conclusion over the issue from the Pakistani authority to take further steps, said CAAV head Dinh Viet Thang.
Aside from these Pakistani pilots, there are no foreign pilots in Vietnam having their licenses issued by the Pakistani authority, the official confirmed.
To date, thousands of foreign pilots are flying for local airlines such as flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, Jetstar Pacific, Vasco, Vietjet Air, Bamboo Airways, according to Tuoi Tre newspaper.
In 2011, South Korea's aviation authority informed CAAV of a case in which Kim Tae Hun, a South Korean pilot that was working at Vietnam Airlines, was suspected to have used a fake license to fly an Airbus A320.
The suspension came after he made a failed landing attempt at a Busan airport in South Korea.
On noticing the problematic landing, the Vietnamese captain immediately took over control of the plane from Kim Tae Hun.
Following a probe into his suspected fake license, CAAV confirmed that Kim Tae Hun had used the fake license and other relevant documents issued by the Indonesian aviation authority to fly Airbus A320 aircraft.
After his fake license was detected, Kim Tae Hun quit his job at Vietnam Airlines in August 2011 before CAAV completed the probe into his case.

The second reason for the victim specified date and time is because she knew that Selena Gomez's former lover attended the Met Gala that year.
However, the document indicated that Justin attended the event, then attended a private party until nearly 4 in the morning.
The singer claims to have enough visual evidence, witnesses to prove this and calls Kadi's accusation a utopian, poor, fabricated, and damaging story for his honor.

Hanoi attracts US$17.6 billion for 229 projects.
Hanoi City is going to present investment certificates for 229 projects with a total value of US$17.6 billion and signed 38 memoranda of understanding worth a combined US$28.6 billion, according to the Tuoi Tre Online website.
Speaking at the Hanoi 2020-Investment and Development Cooperation conference held on June 27, Secretary of Hanoi Party Committee Vuong Dinh Hue said that the capital city contributes 16.7% of the country's gross domestic product and some 19% of the State budget.
Hue stated, the conference is an opportunity to bolster the relationship between local authorities, investors and businesses as well as units bringing foreign investors to the city and to Vietnam.
It is being held after the Covid-19 pandemic has effectively been controlled to reiterate that Hanoi is a safe and attractive destination for investors.
Through the event, Hanoi is expressing its determination to take the lead in the post-Covid-19 economic recovery and development.
It welcomed 1,850 delegates and leaders from 25 centrally-run cities and provinces, key economic zones in the north, ambassadors and representatives of diplomatic corps and others.
According to Hanoi City's Chairman Nguyen Duc Chung, the city has gone 72 days without new Covid-19 infection cases in the community.
All social activities are also returning to normal.
Despite the adverse impacts of the pandemic, Hanoi reported a gross regional domestic product growth rate of 3.39% in the first six months of 2020.
There were 12,650 new enterprises established, with total capital of VND175 trillion, up 9% over the same period last year.
During the January-June period, the city attracted US$4 billion in foreign direct investment capital.
Besides, its tax collection met some 50% of this year's estimate.
Mr. Chung also announced a portfolio of 282 projects that the city is seeking investors for with atotal value of VND483 trillion.
Internet security firm Bkav on June 23 warned the public about VN84App, spyware capable of penetrating into smartphones and stealing personal information, being spread via various fake websites of State agencies including the Ministry of Public Security.
Experts from Bkav told Tuoi Tre Online that in Vietnam, as many as 300 users have fallen prey to the VN84App spyware in a short period of time.
Hackers have tricked users into accessing the fake website of the ministry and downloading the VN84App as a file under the name .apk to their smartphones.
Once successfully installed, the VN84App spyware collects messages, phone numbers and IMEI numbers and sends them to the hackers' server.
During the spyware analysis, the experts discovered the server has a Chinese interface and includes messages such as high-value bank transactions.
Nguyen Van Cuong, head of an analysis team at Bkav, admitted that VN84App is a dangerous spyware that is designed to secretly collect users' messages including OTP codes for bank transactions.
Bkav is cooperating with the National Cyber Security Center under the Ministry of Information and Communications and the Division of Cyber Security and High-tech Crime Prevention at the Hanoi Police to stop the spyware attack, Cuong added.
Returnee from Cameroon becomes country's 353rd Covid-19 patient.
A 31-year-old man returning from Cameroon tested positive for Covid-19 today, June 26, becoming the 353rd Covid-19 patient in Vietnam.
The patient, residing in Thach That District, Hanoi, traveled from Cameroon through Nigeria, Ethiopia and Malaysia before arriving in HCMC on June 24.
He was taken to District 7 Hospital for quarantine after arriving at the city's Tan Son Nhat International Airport.
He is being treated at a field hospital in Cu Chi District, according to the Ministry of Health.
Meanwhile, a patient was reported to have recovered from Covid-19 today.
The 292nd patient was hospitalized on May 17 and has tested negative for Covid-19 twice after over one month of treatment.
Up to now, 330 Covid-19 patients in Vietnam have fully recovered.
Among 23 active cases being treated at six medical centers, four patients have tested negative for Covid-19 once and three others tested negative twice.
Vietnam has reported no new Covid-19 cases in the community for 71 consecutive days.
Ethnic group stops banishing unmarried women to forest for childbirth.
The Gie Trieng ethnic group in Quang Nam Province has called halt to a tradition that prohibited unmarried women from delivering at home.
Ho Thi Thuy, 24, of Phuoc Loc Commune in the province's Phuoc Son District met a man in 2018 and the two planned to get married.
But she became pregnant before the wedding could be held.
The Gie Trieng consider getting pregnant before marriage very unlucky and something that brings bad things to the villagers.
As was their custom, Thuy was not allowed to deliver within the village.
Women in such a situation had to go to the edge of the forest to have their baby.
But Thuy went to the Phuoc Son District Health Center for the delivery.
She was discharged five days later, but her exile did not end there since she could not enter the village for 10 days.
Her husband was waiting at the village entrance to welcome them and take them to the edge of the forest.
He had put up a small tent and a temporary bed made from wooden planks.
He helped out with the cooking and washed their clothes since no villager could get close to mother or child during the 10 days and until the family bought a pig weighing at least 10 kilograms and offered to the village as repentance.
I knew it was not good for me or my child and sanitation was not like at home, but I did not dare flout the village's traditions, Thuy recalls.
If a woman brings her child back home too soon and some disaster strikes the village or someone dies, the blame would fall on the newborn.
Then the offering to the village as penitence had to be a buffalo and alcohol costing over VND30 million ($1,300) to propitiate the gods.
It was better for me to endure the forest than to be punished.
We would not have been able to find the money to buy the buffalo.
Phuoc Loc is situated in the Ngoc Linh mountain range at an altitude of 1,000 meters above sea level.
The village has some 400 households of whom more than 40 percent are considered poor.
In the past they used to be scattered but now live in a residential area on a hill.
Luu Huyen Thoai, chairman of Phuoc Loc Commune, said over the last 10 years, local authorities and village elders have been trying to identify inappropriate customs and gradually eliminate them.
In 2015 the commune authorities launched a campaign to eliminate the tradition of women having to give birth at the edge of the forest.
But some cases have been reported in the last two years in Hamlet 2.
Ho Thi Nhung, 53 years-old, who had delivered five babies at the edge of the forest, said, I had to prepare rice, clothes for the newborn and other things before every delivery and my husband would build a hut for me.
She returned home after one month each time.
In my generation, every Gie Trieng woman had to obey the custom.
Many children died during delivery because of poor medical care.
She went to explain the rationale for the custom.
Villagers consider a child born out of wedlock to be possessed by a ghost.
Thus, when an unmarried mother gives birth at home, the spirit will haunt other villagers too.
Whereas, if the delivery takes place in the forest, the ghost will not know the way to the village.
After local authorities launched several campaigns to raise awareness, in 2016 villagers agreed to abolish this custom, allowing Gie Trieng women to safely deliver at home without being punished by the village.
Now a village health worker, Nhung alerts local officials if she sees a woman head to the forest to give birth so that they could encourage her to go to the commune or district health center for the delivery.
Drug industry sees spurt in hiring on Covid-19 outbreak.
Drug stores and pharmaceutical companies have been scrambling to hire workers as business booms amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
In recent months most major drugstores have been hiring.
A recent report on hiring trends in the pharmaceutical and medical devices fields by recruitment firm Navigos said 51 percent of employers are looking to recruit pharmacists.
The average salary for a pharmacist responsible for consulting and selling drugs at stores like An Khang, Long Chau and Pharmacity is VND5-8 million ($214-$343) a month while drug companies pay VND10-15 million ($428-$643).
Mid-level managers, pharmacists and marketing personnel get salaries of up to VND30 million ($1,290).
During disease outbreaks, many customers tend to also buy common drugs such as analgesics, antipyretics and cough medicines, FPT Securities (FPTS) said.
In February Mekong Capital-backed Pharmacity Pharmacy JSC, the largest drugstore chain in Vietnam, raised VND735 billion ($31.8 million) in a series C funding round and plans to open 350 new stores this year, raising its total to 700.
FPT Retail, Vietnam's second largest electronics retailer, plans to open 50 more Long Chau drug stores this year to take the total number to 70.
According to market research firm Kantar Vietnam Worldpanel, drugstores' revenues increased by 164-168 percent year-on-year in February.
The growth has been spurred by the growing economy, increasing health awareness among the public and positive changes in behaviors of using pharmaceutical products.
The value of the Vietnamese pharmaceutical market is likely to grow to $7.7 billion by 2021 and $16.1 billion by 2026 from around $4.7 billion in 2017, according to market research firm IBM Research.
Vietnam's pharmaceutical sales were estimated at $6.5 billion in 2019, according to securities firm Viet Dragon Securities.
The Ministry of Health estimates there were around 57,000 drugstores last year, most of them small businesses run by families.
According to IMS Health, Vietnam is among 17 countries in the so-called pharmerging markets, a group of countries that are expected to be the pillars of the global pharma industry.
Its drug market is expected to grow at around 10 percent annually for the next five years.
Cambodia bans import of six agricultural products from Vietnam.
Six Vietnamese farm products including cabbages, broccoli, okra, pumpkins, limes and chives have been banned for import by Cambodia after they were found containing pesticide residues that exceeded the permissible quantity.
Cambodia's authorities checked the quality of over 20 types of fruits and vegetables imported from Vietnam, according to Vo Thi Gai Nho, deputy head of the customs agency at Khanh Binh border gate under the An Giang Department of Customs.
The test results found harmful residues in six farm products.
so the Cambodian General Department of Customs and agencies at Chrey Thom international border gate in Kandal Province imposed a ban on importing these agricultural products from Vietnam.
The entire batch of the six types of vegetables was confiscated and destroyed.
Between January and May, bilateral trade revenue between Vietnam and Cambodia reached US$1.2 billion, down 8.1% year-on-year.
Vietnam exported goods worth US$1.7 billion to Cambodia, inching down by 6%.
Over the five-month period, Vietnam's exports of farm produce to the neighboring country skyrocketed by 312% year-on-year.
Foxconn says Vietnam is biggest manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia.
Key Apple supplier, Taiwan's Foxconn, has said for the first time that Vietnam is its largest manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia.
Foxconn's chairman, Young Liu, mentioning this at the company's annual general meeting on Tuesday, said Taiwan, India and Vietnam have been the locations where the world's largest contract manufacturer has been expanding its operations in the last two years.
Foxconn first came to Vietnam in 2007.
Its three plants in the country manufacture and assemble computers, car parts, and other electronics.
Experts say Vietnam has become a promising manufacturing destination for multinationals post-pandemic thanks to its early and effective efforts to contain the novel coronavirus.
Apple has started assembling its wireless earphone Airpods Pro in Vietnam, while Microsoft is scheduled to produce notebooks and desktop computers in the northern region from this quarter.
16 quarantined in Saigon after student diagnosed with diphtheria.
A 20-year-old student in HCMC was diagnosed with diphtheria, prompting health authorities to isolate 16 people who had been in close contact with him.
Lieutenant Colonel Phan Ba Hieu of the infectious diseases department at the 175 Military Hospital, where the unidentified patient is being treated, said on Thursday he had been hospitalized nine days earlier with fever, a sore throat, and swelling in the jaw and neck.
He later tested positive for diphtheria.
The hospital quickly worked together with local authorities to isolate 16 people who had written exams along with him.
All tested negative for diphtheria but were given prophylactics.
The patient is now stable and no longer has fever or sore throat, Hieu said.
HCMC is the second locality in Vietnam to report a diphtheria outbreak this year after Dak Nong Province in the Central Highlands, where 12 people were diagnosed with it this month.
A nine-year-old girl died and another patient is in critical condition.
Diphtheria, which can be prevented with vaccination, is an infection caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheria bacterium.
It spreads through air and direct contact.
Symptoms include fever, sore throat, swallowing difficulty, and white patches in the throat that could block the airway.
Complications include myocarditis, kidney problems, respiratory failure, inflammation of nerves, coma, and death.
U.S begins anti-subsidy probe into auto tires from Vietnam.
The U.S Department of Commerce (DOC) has initiated an anti-subsidy investigation into auto tires made in Vietnam, according to the Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam.
During the investigation, which is set to last 12 months, the DOC can announce preliminary results and adopt temporary anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures.
On May 13, the United States received a request to begin anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into Vietnam's tire products.
Data from the U.S customs agency indicated that in 2019, Vietnam exported tire products worth some US$525 million to the United States.
In July last year, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a high-level warning that the tire products might be subject to trade defense investigations in some foreign countries.
After being notified of the investigation into Vietnamese tires, the ministry immediately took action to support enterprises and exporters including discussing and consulting with relevant associations.
To ensure the effectiveness of the investigation, the ministry has encouraged local auto tire exporters to proactively cooperate with the United States side and provide them with sufficient information.
HCMC terminates three more subsidized bus routes.
Lacking commuters, HCMC has decided to kill off three bus routes operating on subsidies starting next month.
Starting July 1, the three routes numbered 02, 11 and 144 will be removed from the Ho Chi Minh City bus map.
Route 02 connects downtown Ben Thanh Market with Mien Tay Bus Station from where passengers travel on to Mekong Delta, route 11 runs from Ben Thanh to Dam Sen, a theme park in District 11, while route 144 links Mien Tay Bus Station with Nhieu Loc Residential Area in Tan Phu District.
The city's public transport management center under the municipal Department of Transportation said it had failed to attract passengers and the revenue they generated had not been enough to cover expenses.
From late 2018 to date, the city has repeatedly stopped operations of its public buses following a lack of passengers.
It used to have 136 bus routes, and with the upcoming removal of three more routes, only 129 are left.
Of the remaining, 91 are subsidized.
According to official data, an average 305 million passengers use public buses in HCMC a year back in 2012.
For this year, the city had targeted to attract just 147 million.
In the 2014-2018 period, the number of bus passengers in the city had dropped steadily by 6.6 percent each year.
Last year, the decreasing ratio was 13 percent against 2018.
City officials said earlier that public buses are luring fewer passengers due to increasing competition from ride-hailing services.
Quang Nam quarantines 110 pregnant women returning from Japan.
The central province of Quang Nam received and quarantined 345 Vietnamese citizens who returned from Japan, including 110 pregnant women and 14 children, Nguyen Van Hai, director of the provincial Health Department, confirmed today, June 25.
The 345 Vietnamese nationals were quarantined at a police school in Quang Nam's Thang Binh District.
They will undergo health checks and have their samples collected for Covid-19 testing by the Quang Nam Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the health official said.
They are among the 360 passengers who were flown home from Japan on national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines Flight VN 931 that landed at Danang airport on June 24.
Of them, three Japanese experts were quarantined at a Danang hotel, while 12 Vietnamese nationals with health problems were transferred to local hospitals in Danang for quarantine and treatment.
On May 29, Quang Nam received and quarantined 343 Vietnamese citizens stranded in Taiwan, with 243 of them being pregnant women.
On June 5, 212 Vietnamese nationals including 99 pregnant women arrived home from Japan and were isolated in the central province.
The head of the Quang Nam Health Department explained that there were many pregnant women returning home as Vietnam prioritizes the repatriation of pregnant women, people with serious illnesses or suffering from occupational accidents, the elderly, and children.
Hundreds of people in Quang Hoa Commune quarantined over fears of diphtheria.
Hundreds of residents in Dak Nong Province's Quang Hoa Commune have been quarantined, after a girl from the commune died of diphtheria.
Doctor Ha Van Hung, deputy director of the Dak Nong Department of Health, told VnExpress on June 22 that 71 households with 355 people living in Hamlet 6 in Quang Hoa Commune have been quarantined, while the government of the commune has set up two quarantine teams and checkpoints.
Some 550 people who are being quarantined and those who came into close contact with persons suspected of having diphtheria will get vaccines for four more days to wipe out the disease, Hung said.
On June 19, a nine-year-old girl residing in Dak Glong District's Quang Hoa Commune was sent to Dak Nong General Hospital after presenting symptoms such as cough, sore throat and shortness of breath.
A day later, she reportedly died of diphtheria, which damaged her heart.
Meanwhile, a nine-year-old boy identified as Ma Van Thanh, who came into contact with the girl, was also hospitalized.
He is in the intensive care unit of the hospital.
After the two cases of diphtheria were detected, the provincial Department of Health asked the authorities to disinfect all the households in Village 2 in Hamlet 6, Be Van Dan Primary School and the commune's healthcare center, Tuoi Tre Online reported.
In mid-June, four children aged nine to 15 years in Krong No District's Dak Sor Commune tested positive for diphtheria.
These days, face-to-face communication is being replaced with online conversations using social media apps.
In terms of the advantages, social networking sites have made it much easier for us to keep in contact with our loved ones, regardless of geographic locations.
Students studying abroad, for example, can keep in touch with their families and friends on a daily basis using the video call features of Skype, Facebook or various other apps.
Social media is also a powerful tool in marketing and business.
The overuse of social media reduces the quality of interpersonal communication.
The frequent use of social media also affects the style of speaking and writing.
Many teenagers have a habit of using abbreviated words, which are frequently used in text messages or in posts on social media, in their academic essays or formal emails.
Many people are so addicted to social networking sites that they constantly stare at their screens during dinners with their families.
CARS and motorbikes are banned from the old heart of Hoi An, a pretty tourist town in central Vietnam.
When the country's newish prime minister paid a visit, he obligingly travelled on foot.
But as Nguyen Xuan Phuc strode manfully around, his motorcade crept along behind him.
Not many Vietnamese can afford a fleet of blacked-out saloons.
But car-ownership in the communist country is soaring, bringing worries about pollution and congestion.
Sales of cars, vans and lorries rose 55% by volume in 2015, albeit from a low base.
so far this year they are up another third.
Most went to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which between them house about half of Vietnam's urban population.
Compared with its choked neighbours, Vietnam's big cities are relatively uncongested.
The country's 40m or so motorbikes terrify pedestrians, but can thunder 10-abreast along thoroughfares as well as worm down dark alleyways.
Cars, by contrast, block up the pipes.
Only 9% of land in the heart of Hanoi is given over to primary and secondary roads, compared with 32% in Manhattan.
The World Bank in 2011 calculated that if car-use were to reach even the moderate level seen in nearby Malaysia, Vietnam's capital would grind to a complete halt.
The government is conflicted, says Arve Hansen, an academic.
It champions the local car-assembly industry but also slaps stiff taxes on buyers, in part for fear of jams.
A suite of recent trade deals will eventually limit authorities' power to control car-use through tariffs.
A pact with South-East Asian neighbours, which comes into full force in 2018, could see cheap cars pour in from Thailand.
The appeal of buying a car may grow even as Vietnam's roads clog up.
The growing risk of collision with a car is making motorcycling more dangerous.
Motorists who know they will end up in jams prefer to do it in air-conditioned vehicles than perched on sweaty bike seats.
Longer travel times are also putting Vietnamese off buses, which were anyway hot and unreliable.
Use of Hanoi's underfunded public buses has dropped 14% in a year.
New urban rail systems should help a little.
The first of at least six metro lines is under construction in Ho Chi Minh City.
two elevated railways are being built in Hanoi.
But it will take years to complete these networks, and the fast-growing cities they will serve are transforming as they are built.
Hanoi in particular is sprawling, helped along by policies that encourage local authorities to build outward, rather than up.
City officials are making do.
Bigwigs in Ho Chi Minh City talk of narrowing pavements to widen roads.
Hanoi insists more and better buses are revving up.
In June cadres in the capital said they thought improvements in public transport would eventually allow them to ban Hanoi's 5m motorbikes from the heart of the city.
It would be better to ban cars.
Children growing up in Costa Rica are surrounded by some of the most beautiful and diverse landscapes in the world.
Preserving tropical rainforests isn't Costa Rica's only success, because the government also makes sure everyone has access to health-care and education.
So when the New Economics Foundation released its second Happy Planet Index, Costa Rica came out number one.
The index is a ranking of countries based on their impact on the environment and the health and happiness of their citizens.
According to Mariano Rojas, a Costa Rican economics professor, Costa Rica is a mid-income country where citizens have plenty of time for themselves and for their relationships with others.
A mid-income level allows most citizens to satisfy their basic needs.
The government makes sure that all Costa Ricans have access to education, health and nutrition services.
Costa Ricans, he believes, are not interested in status or spending money to show how successful they are.
Created in 2008, the Happy Planet Index examines happiness on a national level and ranks 143 countries according to three measurements.
their citizens' happiness, how long they live (which reflects their health), and how much of the planet's resources each country consumes.
According to researcher Saamah Abdallah, the Index also measures the outcomes that are most important, and those are happy, healthy lives for everyone.
Psychologists are calling for the smacking of children in the family home to be outlawed due to the effect it can have on their mental health.
A motion has been put forward to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) from the Association of Educational Psychologists (AEP) urging the government to acknowledge that physical punishment can have negative long-term effects on a child's development.
Parents and carers are currently legally allowed to smack children lightly if it can be described as a reasonable punishment, as outlined in section 58 of the Children Act 2004.
However, psychologists who have backed the ban state that hitting is never an effective method of disciplining a child, no matter the circumstances.
Corporal punishment became illegal in British state schools in 1986, but remained legal in private schools until 1998 in England and Wales, until 2000 in Scotland and until 2003 in Northern Ireland.
John Drewicz, president of the AEP, is due to speak today at the annual TUC Conference in Manchester.
He'll outline how smacking impacts a child's mental health and perpetuates damaging messages about violence.
His speech will discuss how smacking a child can negatively impact their mental health and can encourage them to behave in a more aggressive and violent manner.
Furthermore, he'll reference several countries where a full ban on smacking children is already in place, including Sweden, Ireland, Spain, Germany and Portugal.
The motion being put forward by the AEP references similar initiatives in Scotland and Wales.
Earlier this year, it was announced that the Welsh government was proposing to ban smacking children by asking the country's population for its views on the issue.
Children's charity Save the Children states that all children have a right to protection from violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect, and describes the act of smacking a child as a form of child abuse.
UK households spending more than income for first time in 30 years.
The data confirms that British households have been collectively supporting their spending through a combination of reducing their saving levels and taking on more debt.
UK households collectively spent more than they earned in 2017 – the first time this has happened in almost 30 years, according to the Office for National Statistics.
The data confirms what other indicators have been signalling for some time.
that British households have been supporting their spending through a combination of reducing saving levels and taking on more debt, with potentially hazardous consequences for the wider economy.
On Thursday the ONS presented figures, taken from last month's sectoral accounts, showing that the net lending of the household sector in 2017 was minus £22,6bn.
The last time this measure was negative was 1988, when there was a deficit of £394m.
The UK household saving ratio, which measures total saving as a share of total disposable income, dipped to a record low of 3 per cent last year and stood at only 4.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018.
The difference between the saving ratio and net lending is that that the latter includes households' investments in home improvement.
Once expenditure, such as the building of loft extensions is included, households, collectively, are spending more than they are taking in after paying tax.
The aggregate UK household debt-to-GDP ratio (excluding student loans) soared in the years preceding the global financial crisis, shooting up from around 95 per cent in 2000 to a peak of 144 per cent in 2008.
This was one of the most rapid household leverage buildups in the world and economists argue that it was one of the reasons Britain suffered such a severe recession a decade ago, as households stopped spending in order to repair their finances, suddenly sucking demand out of the economy.
The debt-to-GDP ratio fell steadily to 121 per cent in 2015, as households steadily reduced their leverage, but it has been creeping up over the past three years and now stands back at 125 per cent.
This debt is mainly made up of mortgage debt, reflecting high and rising UK house prices.
But unsecured consumer credit borrowing – things like car loans and credit cards – has been growing rapidly since 2015, outstripping income growth and prompting warnings to private banks from the Bank of England about their underwriting standards.
However, the Bank has also noted that the debt-service burdens on households seem manageable by historic standards, reflecting the environment of still very low interest rates.
No job, no money.
Life in Vietnam for immigrants deported by U.S.
It wasn't until Pham Chi Cuong saw the plane waiting to deport him from the United States that it sunk in that he was about to be sent back to Vietnam, the country he fled in 1990.
Cuong and at least three other deportees who had lived in America for decades were returned to Vietnam in December 2017 as part of a renewed Trump administration push to deport immigrants convicted of crimes in the United States.
The expulsions were carried out despite a 2008 bilateral agreement that Vietnamese immigrants who arrived in the United States prior to 1995, many of whom had supported the now defunct U.S backed state of South Vietnam, would not be sent back.
Cuong and the other men, who spoke to Reuters this week in Ho Chi Minh City, said they spent the 17-hour flight in enforced silence, their hands and legs in restraints.
Adjusting to life in Vietnam, the men all said, has been difficult.
They said they were viewed with suspicion by Vietnamese officials and have had trouble finding work.
If you ask me do you want to come back to the U.S ?
I'll give you the answer yes, but I don't know how, said Cuong, who left a wife and children back home in Orlando, Florida.
Another of the men, who asked to be identified only by his last name of Nguyen, told Reuters he was asked by local police officials when he returned to Vietnam if he worked for the CIA.
He said he was deported to Cam Ranh Bay, a place he had fled after the war because of his family's connections to the losing side.
I ran away from there, said Nguyen.
There were a lot of Americans there at the time, and my family worked for them, he added.
My uncle died in the war.
He was a South Vietnamese soldier.
Vietnam has expressed reluctance to take back pre-1995 immigrants.
The White House has declined to comment on the Vietnamese deportations.
The happiest country in the world.

Amidst all the happy hustle and bustle associated with the approach of Tết (Lunar New Year), this topic is being revisited this year on social media with surprising fervour.
If memory serves me right, the topic was first raised more than 10 years ago by a famous professor who controversially suggested that the Lunar New Year celebration be done away with, and Viet Nam as a nation shifts to celebrating the solar New Year, based on the Gregorian calendar.
The professor's argument went thus.
it wasted time that students should spend studying.
the celebration promoted social evils like gambling and drinking.
there were more traffic accidents, and working days were wasted.
Many people applauded this suggestion, including economists and other experts.
They argued that having two different holidays for the solar and lunar new years affected businesses and production.
This year, the argument has gained some added traction, with people saying greater international integration, an avowed national target, was a reason to celebrate just one New Year.
Japan is pointed to as an example, with some even going to the extent of saying celebrating the New Year like Westerners was one of the factors in the East Asian giant's many economic achievements, including becoming the third largest economy in the world.
Other reasons have weighed in against the festival, too.
Some people said it stressed them out.
They were tired of shopping before the holiday, and then cooking and visiting relatives during the holiday.
Actually, I am afraid of Tết now.
The traditional part of it has been gradually vanishing, said Nguyen Hai Huyen, from Ha Noi.
It was no longer a big family affair with people getting together to make things, she said.
Every year, I am exhausted preparing for Tết (on my own), and the enjoyment is missing, really, she said.
Utter nonsense.
Predictably, the other side is outraged.
I've seen this nonsensical debate going on these days over whether we should abolish the traditional Tet festival, said Tô Quyên, a Vietnamese woman living in the United Kingdom.
I say nonsensical because this should not be an issue at all.
If you are Vietnamese, you celebrate Tết.
This cannot change.
She has a point, I would say.
There can be no argument that Tet is the biggest and perhaps the oldest festival in Việt Nam, bringing people together to celebrate a sacred, meaningful annual event.
It is an occasion when members of a family, no matter where they are and what they do to earn a living, get together and pray in front of the ancestral altar.
Returning home to celebrate Tet is de rigueur for just about every Vietnamese citizen, whether they are away from home within the country or abroad.
In fact, the festival draws thousands of foreign visitors looking to get an authentic feel for the country.
Dương Trung Quốc, a historian, says that like other countries in Asia, Vietnamese people are original rice farmers, and their lives are connected closely with lunar calendar.
All the important events of a Vietnamese person's life, the one-month old celebration, weddings, funerals, and death commemorations are based on lunar calendar, he said.
This has been happening for thousands of years.
Why should we change now?
Are we to dismiss and undermine our own culture and identity for the sake of economic efficiency?
I would say that this economic efficiency is even more of an abstract idea than a cultural festival that is linked to actual, daily life events like harvests, change of seasons, traditional festival food.
the list goes on and on.
So let us take the learned professor's contention that the long celebration of Tet is one of the reasons Việt Nam is less developed and lags behind other countries.
What about Singapore, South Korea and Thailand.
We all know people from other countries flock to Thailand for the kingdom's own New Year celebrations.
And what of India?
Its citizens probably celebrate a dozen different New Years, which are local holidays.
All that cultural diversity should be destroyed to honour commercial gods?
I am reminded of the story where a development worker approaches a poor man sitting and relaxing under a tree at the beach.
The expert advises the man to work hard and make progress.
For what?
So that he can sit and relax at the beach.
If we work harder (as if we don't do that now) and do not celebrate Tết, what will we do with the added prosperity?
Celebrate Tết.
And there is evidence aplenty that honouring the commercial god will rob the soul of a nation and its people.
Let's get this clear, once and for all.
Tet marks our culture and our identity, and it represents our nation's soul.
Why France Is Banning Smartphones at School Just as the U.S is Letting More Students Use Them.
French lawmakers have voted to ban smartphones in schools, affecting kids up to the age of 14 or 15, as of the start of the new academic year in September.
Smartphones have already been banned in the classrooms of French primary and middle schools since the start of the decade, but they were allowed on other parts of school grounds.
Now, they're banned across school premises, although secondary schools can still make exceptions for extracurricular activities or for disabled students.
When he floated the idea of the new ban last December, education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer complained that these days the children don't play at break time anymore.
They are just all in front of their smartphones, and from an educational point of view, that's a problem.
Blanquer had previously suggested that pupils should leave their phones in secure boxes when they arrive at school, but critics pointed out the logistical issues of such a scheme.
Now, pupils will have to either leave their devices at home or turn them off while at school.
Such measures are not uncommon in Europe, and there is often backing from teachers and students alike.
A third of British schools ban smartphones in the classroom, and most Swedish schools impose similar prohibitions.
On the other hand, Italy reversed a classroom smartphone ban a couple years ago and is trying to encourage the use of the devices as learning aids.
The bans are also falling away in the U.S - a survey earlier this year found that, while over 90% of public schools imposed them in 2009 through 2010, the proportion had dropped to 66% in 2015 through 2016.
This seems to be a result of parents wanting to be able to contact their kids at all times, in an era where school shootings are common.
A 2012 survey of more than 5,400 middle and high school students found that 19% consumed one or more cups of coffee each day, with more than half saying they drank some form of caffeinated drink to wake up, despite being aware of the harms of consuming too much caffeine.
The study stated that middle and high school students are aware of the dangers of caffeine but are still in the reality where they must consume it.
This shows that educating the students on the dangers of caffeine abuse alone cannot prevent them from harming themselves.
The findings were supported by lawmaker Kim Sang-hee of the Minjoo party, who since proposed the bill to ban the sale of caffeine, which has now been made law and will come into effect on September 14.
However, critics note that students can easily walk a few minutes from their schools to buy coffee or other caffeinated drinks.
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, caffeine has been linked to some harmful health effects in children, including on the developing neurologic and cardiovascular systems.
They add that, in general, children should avoid caffeine-containing beverages, including soda.
Green Wave Washes Over Mainstream Shopping.
Research in Britain has shown that green consumers continue to flourish as a significant group amongst shoppers.
This suggests that politicians who claim environmentalism is yesterday's issue may be seriously misjudging the public mood.
A report from Mintel, the market research organisation, says that despite recession and financial pressures, more people than ever want to buy environmentally friendly products and a 'green wave' has swept through consumerism, taking in people previously untouched by environmental concerns.
The recently published report also predicts that the process will repeat itself with ethical concerns, involving issues such as fair trade with the Third World and the social record of businesses.
Companies will have to be more honest and open in response to this mood.
Mintel's survey, based on nearly 1,000 consumers, found that the proportion who look for green products and are prepared to pay more for them has climbed from 53 per cent in 1990 to around 60 per cent in 1994.
On average, they will pay 13 per cent more for such products, although this percentage is higher among women, managerial and professional groups and those aged 35 to 44.
Between 1990 and 1994 the proportion of consumers claiming to be unaware of or unconcerned about green issues fell from 18 to 10 per cent but the number of green spenders among older people and manual workers has risen substantially.
Regions such as Scotland have also caught up with the south of England in their environmental concerns.
According to Mintel, the image of green consumerism as associated in the past with the more eccentric members of society has virtually disappeared.
The consumer research manager for Mintel, Angela Hughes, said it had become firmly established as a mainstream market.
She explained that as far as the average person is concerned environmentalism has not gone off the boil.
In fact, it has spread across a much wider range of consumer groups, ages and occupations.
Mintel's 1994 survey found that 13 per cent of consumers are very dark green, nearly always buying environmentally friendly products, 28 per cent are 'dark green', trying 'as far as possible to buy such products, and 21 per cent are pale green - tending to buy green products if they see them.
Another 26 per cent are armchair greens.
they said they care about environmental issues but their concern does not affect their spending habits.
Only 10 per cent say they do not care about green issues.
Four in ten people are ethical spenders, buying goods which do not, for example, involve dealings with oppressive regimes.
This figure is the same as in 1990, although the number of armchair ethicals has risen from 28 to 35 per cent and only 22 per cent say they are unconcerned now, against 30 per cent in 1990.
Hughes claims that in the twenty-first century, consumers will be encouraged to think more about the entire history of the products and services they buy, including the policies of the companies that provide them and that this will require a greater degree of honesty with consumers.
Among green consumers, animal testing is the top issue - 48 per cent said they would be deterred from buying a product it if had been tested on animals - followed by concerns regarding irresponsible selling, the ozone layer, river and sea pollution, forest destruction, recycling and factory farming.
However, concern for specific issues is lower than in 1990, suggesting that many consumers feel that Government and business have taken on the environmental agenda.
Ministry proposes cut in corporate tax, but hikes for other taxes.
The Ministry of Finance's (MOF) recent proposals on raising many kinds of taxes and fees have been facing strong opposition from the public.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc at the GMS6 Business Summit in late March 2013 said the government is going to cut the corporate income tax (CIT) from 20-22 percent to 15-17 percent.
Analysts think the 15-17 percent CIT would be applied to micro and small-and medium-sized enterprises, respectively, as proposed by MOF.
The ministry suggested a tax reduction only once recently, but it has frequently proposed to raise tax.
In August 2017, MOF stirred up the public when proposing to raise the VAT (value added tax) from 10 percent to 12 percent and cut the number of products subject to the preferential VAT rate of 5 percent, because the 10 percent tax rate isn't in line with international practice and cannot ensure the nation's financial security.
Also in 2017, the ministry insisted on raising the environmental protection tax to VND4,000 on every liter of petrol sold, saying taxes from crude oil are decreasing and the petrol price in Vietnam is low compared with 122 countries.
In early 2018, MOF proposed raising the personal income tax rate (PIT) to help increase the state budget revenue.
Most recently, in mid-April, MOF mentioned a plan to tax houses with the value of over VND700 million and tax cars worth over VND1.5 billion.
Explaining the taxing of individuals assets, the ministry said that this kind of tax exists in many countries.
According to OECD (The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development), the tax brings 4 percent of revenue in Canada, 3 percent in the US, and 0.
6 percent in developed countries.
However, Vietnam's annual income per capita is very modest, just around $2,000.
Raising the tax on workers with low living standards may turn the near-poor into the poor, and turn low-income earners into near-poor, said Bui Duc Thu, a National Assembly deputy.
The real reason behind MOF's decision to propose a tax hike is to increase the source of revenue for the state budget.
However, as Ngo Tri Long, a renowned economist, said, the high public debt and prolonged budget deficit must not be blamed on low tax collections but on embezzlement, inappropriate investments, and loose financial discipline.
If the problems aren't settled, the budget deficit will still occur even if MOF raises taxes many times, he said.
Ignoring protests, Finance Ministry raises environmental tax on petrol products.
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is compiling the amended Environment Protection Tax Law.
From July, every liter of petrol will be charged an additional VND1,000 in environmental tax.
The proposal to amend the Environmental Protection Tax Law has faced strong opposition over the last two years when the draft law was opened for public opinion.
Because the amendment of the law to expand the tax frame has been delayed, MOF immediately proposed raising the environmental tax rate to the ceiling level, even though the amended environment tax law will be open for discussion again in 2019.
MOF said 40 ministries and branches agree with the draft resolution on changing the environmental protection tax rates.
MOF will raise the environmental protection tax rate on petrol from VND3,000 per liter to VND4,000, and on oil & lubricant from VND900 to VND2,000.
The tax rate on air fuel, VND3,000 per liter, the highest rate in the tax framework, will remain unchanged.
As for kerosene, MOF has proposed to raise the tax rate from VND300 per liter to the highest rate designated in the tax framework at VND2,000, rejecting the opinion that it would be better to raise the rate only slightly to encourage production.
At present, E5 petrol is retailed at VND18,932 per liter.
An analyst estimates that everyliter of petrol bears has many kinds of taxes and fees, totaling VND8,500.
If the environmental tax rate increases by VND1,000, consumers will have to pay over VND9,000 to the state budget, or half of the petrol retail price, for every liter of petrol.
Tran The Truyen, CEO of Saigon Petro, warned that if the tax rates are raised as planned by MOF, the price will be only be a little higher than E5 petrol, about VND200 per liter.
The modest gap will prompt people to turn their backs to bio-petrol.
Truyen suggested applying a lower tax rate on E5 to help encourage the use of biofuel, stressing that most E5 users are low-income earners who need protection.
However, MOF doesn't think this idea is reasonable.
Idea has rejected the idea of applying preferential tax rates on petrol and oil products meeting Euro 4 and higher standards.
Mr. Ngo Tri Long, a pricing expert, commented that MOF's arguments are unconvincing and that the ministry is just trying every possible way to raise tax to offset the decrease in tax collection caused by tariff cuts under foreign trade agreements (FTAs).
