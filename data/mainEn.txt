The 45th President of the United States of America – Donald Trump, he beaten off one of the former President’s wife named Hilary Clinton and has taken office on January 20, 2017.
Actually, he has already risen to fame as a business magnate and TV personality far before he moves to live in the White House.
However, unlike other previous ones, this President has been frequently criticized and hit the headlines.
As he took up office, Trump immediately managed to hobble Obamacare – one of the biggest achievements of his previous, President Obama.
The action made public opinion break out, and people not only in the USA but also in the world called him the cruel guy.
Obamacare was an act that make health insurance available for US citizens, especially the poor, and its official name of the law is the Affordable Care Act.
However, President Trump considered this act completely the opposite with one of important American values, independence, which means that the America, regardless of the rich of the poor, must be self-reliant and depends on no one to feed and finance them.
As a result, he got rid of this law and was strongly censured.
Recently, President Donald Trump has grabbed the headlines of many magazines regardless inside or outside the USA for throwing a grenade triggering the commercial war between his nation and China.
The press acknowledged that he is hobbling China because this nation’s economy is getting bigger and might gulp his USA down in a near future.
However, it is true that this trade war is the economic sanctions after mischief and tricks China did not only with the business but also the politics of America.
It is not wrong for people to say that he is evil, but he just does the right things and protects the Americans.
Kim Jong Un is the Supreme Leader of North Korea who has been in power since 2011.
Although he has been well-known recently, his life is still a mystery to the world.
He was born in the early 1980s to singer Ko Young Hee and North Korea dictator Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather was Kim Il Sung – founder of the Kim dynasty.
Though Kim Jong Un had an elder brother and half-brother, his father still chose him as his successor.
After his father’s death in 2011, Kim ascended to power.
Unlike other presidents, Kim has a harsh and fierce policy of governance and leadership.
It is said that the leader of North Korea – Kim Jong Un is extremely cruel, dangerous but not crazy.
His pursuit of nuclear weapons, incendiary rhetoric and odd appearance prove to that saying.
Kim instructs his guys to create a very strong advanced and dangerous nuclear weapons that threaten the strongest nation in terms of military – the United States, and President Trump has to scratch his head over the nuclear weapon agreement with the two in order to persuade him uninstalling all of the booms.
This is the reason why we have the US – North Korean Singapore and Hanoi Summit.
Not only the military system is focused, but also all areas of daily life in North Korea which are strictly controlled by Kim’s regime is the topic of many discussions.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is home to more than 24 million people living under a harsh form of communist rule.
People have to ask permission to travel around and it is difficult for visitors to enter the country.
All TVs and radios are tuned to state channels and people are caught listening to foreign broadcasts face harsh punishments.
These controls make most North Koreans have little or even no idea of the outside world, and it is seemed that these citizens are trapped in caged.
The world, especially Mr.Trump of the US are doing their best to make at least small changes to this country and help its people have chance to meet the outside.
Facebook is one of the most popular and biggest social media globally that most of the people worldwide use and access everyday.
It provide us with smart and convenient features that help us connect to the outside world without going anywhere but stay at home or office only;
morever, people nowadays can work and study or go shopping online at home via Facebook.
However, despite these brilliant features, it is argued that Facebook also has its own psychological costs that are bad for the human being’s mental health.
To be more specific concerning the side effects of the social medium – Facebook, firstly, it can become addictive and causes intense passivity and weak communication.
Besides society’s most common addictive substances like coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol, it is obviously that Facebook – a cyber phenomenon in the world – has been becoming a serious addiction got by people in all ages.
In fact, friends, families, colleagues and partners nowadays are no longer happy and excited in engaging a face-to-face conversation.
They even feel disconcerted because of having nothing to say with each other.
Intepreting for this strange and popular situation, Facebook is one of the reason that people have been blaming on.
Myriad people daily spend hours to browse Facebook, in other words, they are becoming phone heads or phone addicts.
Furthermore, the more people use Facebook, the more jealousy they get.
It is obvious that people are naturally inclined to engage in social comparison.
For more details, with just a glance at the New Feeds, people can updates from their social cycles;
when people see someone who has a happier or more successful life then theirs, such as a new fancy car or an expensive beautiful dress, not only can Facebook make them feel like they are not sharing in their friends’s happiness and success, but it can also make them feel envious of their friends’s wonderful life.
As these negative social comparisons happen and accumulate day in day out, human being will definitely get extremely depressed and anxious leading to the antisocial and autism syndromes that can cause a lot of serious consequences, especially the suicide.
Facebook can be awesomely good for humankind if they exploit it properly, and it can also precipitate extremely serious and unpredictable consequences if people excessively abuse and improperly employ it.
We all know that natural disasters happen all over the world, and they can be utterly devastating for people’s lives and the environments we live in.
There are many different natural causes leading to natural disasters, and being aware of these causes enables us to be better prepared when they do arrive.
One of the most common natural disasters is flooding, which occurs when a river bursts its banks and the water spills out onto the floodplain.
During wet periods, flood warnings are often put in place because of a great deal of heavy rain.
There are other risk factors for flooding that we have to mention such as steep-sided channels cause fast surface run-off, the lack of vegetation and woodland break the flow of water.
In other words, there is little to slow the floodwater down.
Earthquakes are another common natural disaster on the list that can cause many fatalities.
Earthquakes are caused by the movements of the plates in the earth’s crust.
These plates do not always move smoothly and can get stuck, and then cause a build-up of pressure – the reason why earthquake occur.
In addition to this, an earthquake under the water can also cause a tsunami by pushing large volumes of water to the surface causing great waves.
Tsunamis can also be caused by underwater volcanic eruptions which are another natural disaster caused by magma escaping from inside the earth.
An explosion takes place, releasing the magma from a confined space, and that is why huge quantities of gas and dust are always released during a volcanic eruption.
Inside of the volcano, the magma travels up and then pours out over the surrounding area as lava.
Last but not least, one of the most common natural disasters that we commonly forgot is wildfires.
They take place in many different countries all over the world, particularly during the summertime, and can be caused by a range of different reasons.
Some of the things starting the wildfires can be totally natural, while others can be manmade, but the speed they spread is entirely down to nature.
There are two main natural causes of wildfires which are the sun’s heat and lightning strikes.
Other reasons are campfires, smoking, fireworks and many other things caused by humans.
The reasons why they spread so quickly are prolonged hot, dry weather, where the vegetation dries out, which is why they often take place in woodland.
A huge portion of my early childhood memories is rather patchy and fuzzy where I barely recall the names and faces of my kindergarten teachers or classmates.
But the only thing that still stayed on with me from that period was the stories by Enid Blyton.
I could proudly say that I grew up with Blyton’s characters who accompanied me from my adolescence years well into my mid-elementary school years because her stories had varying levels of difficulty that catered to a wide group of readers.
For myself, this author opened up my young impressionable mind to different worlds, worlds that were magical and also culturally different.
For example, boarding schools are not common options in Singapore because for a tiny island like ours, my elementary school was only a 15-minute walk away from home.
Yet through the Malory Towers series, I knew more about how other children lived in other areas of the world.
As compared to watching cartoon, her stories left children much more room for imagination and creative thinking.
I conjured images about how Moon-face and Saucepan Man from the Faraway Tree series might look like and what color would an elf’s clothes be.
In my mind, elves were never as raggedy as Dobby in Harry Potter or as suave as Legolas in Lord of The Rings.
Instead, they were diminutive in stature, slender with sharp ears and friendly almond eyes wearing grey clothes.
After more than a decade of outgrowing Blyton’s books, I am deeply and truely impressed that she was able to articulate thoughts suitable for a child.
Being an author or writer, it is imperative to write in a way clearly understood by the readers.
As such, children authors need to simplify their thoughts and articulate using grammar and vocabulary appropriate for different age groups.
As an adult, one could imagine the difficulties to be a children’s author, much less a successful and timeless one for requires us to stop thinking like a grown-up and adopt the children’s psyche.
The Earth is very old.
It has changed often during its long life, and it is still changing.
Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex were alive, the Earth was much warmer.
There was very little ice on the land or on the sea, even in the very north or the very south of the world.
And the sea was much higher than it is today.
There have been many changes since that time, sometimes to a warmer climate, sometimes to a colder one.
About 20,000 years ago, for example, a time called an Ice Age began.
There was ice over much of the world, and it was 3 kilometres deep over much of North America and Europe.
And the sea was not as high as it is today.
Our climate has changed many times, and it will change again.
But now, for the very first time, people are changing the climate.
In the year 1900, the Earth was 0.
7 C colder than it was in 2000, just one hundred years later.
This change did not happen because of the Earth’s orbit – it happened because of us.
Some people think that this is a small change.
But think about this.
A change of just 5 to 7 C can start or finish an Ice Age.
Can the climate change like this?
Scientists think that it can – but not as quickly as this.
Scientists do not always agree.
Some think that the climate is changing a lot, and some think that it is changing a little.
Some think that it will change quickly, and some slowly.
But all scientists agree that climate change is happening.
The important question is this: how dangerous will the change be?
Al Gore, who worked next to President Clinton of the USA between 1993 and 2001, thinks that the change will be dangerous.
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore describes how the Earth’s climate has changed.
He has talked about the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years, but is he right?
Is climate change a dangerous problem?
Must we do something about it?
And what can we do?
One out of every two marriages nowadays ends in divorce and lots of divorcing families include children.
Parents who are obtaining a divorce are usually worried about the impact the divorce will have on their children.
During this difficult period, parents may be absorbed with their own problems, but continue to be the most important people in their children’s lives.
While parents may be ravaged or relieved by the divorce, children are constantly frightened and confused by the threat to their security.
Some parents feel so overwhelmed or hurt by the divorce that they may turn to the child for direction or comfort.
Divorce could be misinterpreted by children unless parents tell them what is happening, how they are involved and not involved, and what will happen to them.
Talking to children about a divorce is difficult.
The following tips can help both the young and the old with the challenge and stress of these conversations:Don’t keep it a secret or wait until the last minute.
Tell your child together with your spouse.
Keep things simple and straight-forward.
Inform them the divorce is not their fault.
Admit that this will be upsetting and sad for everyone.
Reassure your child that you both still love them and will be their parents forever.
Do not discuss each other’s faults or problems with the child.
Children will do best if they know that their mother and father will still be their parents and remain involved with them even though the marriage is ending and the parents won’t live together.
Pressure on a child to "choose" sides or long custody disputes can be particularly harmful for the youngster and can add to the damage of the divorce.
Research indicates that children do best when parents can cooperate on behalf of the child.
Parents’ ongoing commitment to the child’s well-being is vital.
If a child shows signs of distress, the family doctor or pediatrician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment.
In addition, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can meet with the parents to help them learn how to make the strain of the divorce easier on the entire family.
Psychotherapy for the children of a divorce, and the divorcing parents, can be helpful.
Vietnam is a tropical country located in Southeast Asia – the center of the world sea-route.
The tropical monsoon climate gives Vietnam resource-rich biological diversity.
Besides, Vietnam has S shape with 3620 kilometers of the coast with abundant tourism and seafood potentialities.
Việt Nam là một đất nước nhiệt đới nằm ở khu vực Đông Nam Á – trung tâm của tuyến đường biển quốc tế.
Khí hậy nhiệt đới gió mùa tạo nên sự đa dạng tài nguyên sinh học của Việt Nam.
Bên cạnh đó, đất nước Việt Nam có hình chữ S với 3260km đường biển có tiềm năng du lịch và thủy hải sản phong phú.
Vietnam has a long-lasting history with over four thousand years through the ups and downs of history and politics.
There are 54 ethnic groups in total and the Kinh is the largest one.
All the ethnic groups all over the country live peacefully under a common roof – Vietnam.
Vietnam is a country with special cultures, one of which is the Tet holiday.
From the first Dynasty of Vietnam (the Hung King Dynasty), our ancestors celebrated Tet Holiday every year.
Tet is the biggest holiday in Vietnam, which is held according to the Lunar Calendar.
In the Tet, we cooked Banh Chung and Banh Giay, two special dishes made from sticky rice as Vietnam is an agriculture country.
Banh Chung is wrapped in square-shaped – the symbolic meaning of the earth, land, sun, men.
Banh Giay is wrapped in circle-shaped – the symbolic meaning of the ocean, sky, moon, women.
Banh Chung and Banh Giay together are the symbol of the harmony of the universe.
Thousand years have passed and this nice cultural feature has been kept until now.
Vietnamese people are friendly, intelligent, hard-working and thirsty for moving up.
You might think that Vietnam is a small country, but we never step back.
Far back in history, we proved it.
Throughout the ups and downs of history, we have defeated a lot of strong enemies from different lands.
In the wartime, both the French and the USA army became our defeaters.
Nowadays, we are building our country to become richer, more beautiful as the strong wish from Mr.Ho Chi Minh.
The MOONCAKE is a traditional Chinese pastry which is enjoyed during the annual Mid-Autumn festival by many people around the world.
The name "mooncake" comes from this festival, since families gather to celebrate this lunar festival and watch the full moon.
MOONCAKES are also an iconic Chinese dessert with a colorful history dating back thousands of years.
MOONCAKES are baked into round shapes, but varies in sizes and the varied ingredients based on different areas’ interpretation.
It is commonly made with a thin crust, thick sweet filling from lotus seed paste, and contains two yolks from salted duck eggs.
The round duck egg yolks perform the full moon.
The top layer of the mooncake includes symbols of the moon festival imprinted on them or is also decorated to have good luck characters.
The Mid-Autumn festival is considered as the second most important holiday in China after the Lunar New Year.
The annual festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month on the lunar calendar.
The origins of this festival dates back to Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE) where farmers celebrate the harvest of the crops and express thanks to the Mountain Gods.
The MOONCAKE became the offering as the public worshiped the moon during every autumn’s lunar.
There are also a great number of legends and folktales associated with the origins of moon cakes which have circulated.
Another importance is the shape of the moon as well as mooncake.
Thus, the round mooncake is not only a delicacy and dessert enjoyed, but it emphasizes the special importance that Chinese people attach to family reunion.
Police is not just the principle executor of the laws but also the primary keeper of peace and order.
Its functions include enforcing the laws, enacted by the legislature as well as the decisions of the court, besides, of course, preventing crime.
Police officers have a lot of authority in society and they are very important people for enforcing the law and ensuring the safety.
Police officer is an official employee of the police force.
"Police officers help to prevent crime and disorder, and uphold the law".
A decision to become a police officer is not an easy one.
Not only because it involves a lot of risky and dangerous situations, but because it puts a great responsibility on you.
Being a police officer is not just a job, even though you have salary.
You definitely have to think hard before you take a decision.
It’s well known that many young people’s police officer’s carriers end soon after they get started.
"When young men and women begin their law enforcement careers as police officers, they have no idea just how many pitfalls lay before them. Too many new police officers listen to bad advice, and they develop bad working habits".
Moreover, to become a police officer you have to meet a number of essentially important requirements which are, for example, to be physically available for those kinds of activities that being a police force employee must perform.
All your abilities and skills are thoroughly checked, since your level of competence and the quality of your performance will probably result in human life rescuing.
If thinking about future prospects, "employment of police is expected to increase about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2020. This is because people are concerned about crime and safety".
And probably, that’s a change for the better.
The summer before my junior year in high school, my family and I took a trip to a completely new world.
Being from a small town, I had never really been exposed to the elements of a large city such as New York City.
My trip there was like discovering an entirely new way of life that I had only heard stories of previously.
For about the tenth time the morning of the flight, I checked my room to make sure I didn’t leave anything essential behind.
My stomach was doing flips as we arrived at the airport and made our way to the gate.
It didn’t get much better than this: I watched through the window as the runway zoomed by and the buildings and houses became smaller and smaller as the plane gained altitude.
An exhilarating feeling overcame me as I realized that I would soon be in one of the most amazing cities of the United States.
As we stood waiting for a taxi outside of the airport, it was immediately apparent to me that New York City was not the same as New Caney, Texas.
It seemed like everyone there was in a hurry to get to another place.
The loud and constant sound of cars honking was heard throughout the entire trip.
As soon as a car seemed to be going slower than the person behind him liked, he would hear the horn of that car to let him know that he was apparently holding everybody else up!
When we found our hotel in Times Square, I noticed that it wasn’t just the cars that were in a hurry.
Everyone in the streets was walking at a brisk pace that indicated a rush to be somewhere.
The transportation of the city was also far different than anything that I had ever been exposed to.
In my little town, a bike, a car, or even walking was perfectly suitable for getting around town, but in this foreign land, there were many more ways for one to get to another destination.
Everywhere you looked, there were people hailing taxis, waiting on buses, rushing underground to the subway stations, walking frantically, or desperately trying to maneuver their own cars through the busy streets.
Just standing and watching the many people rushing their own separate ways was an interesting observation.
In addition to the people and transportation, the buildings were also an incredible sight.
Each street was crammed with buildings that were built side by side with no room in between them, and a number of skyscrapers were present throughout the city as well.
I was awestruck again as we went inside some of these buildings such as the Empire State Building and made our way towards the top.
Standing outside of one of the top stories of the Empire State Building was awesome.
I could hold the entire city in my hand from this view.
I could even see Ellis Island a distance away from there.
The stores were also large compared to the ones of my little town.
A small retail store in New Caney would be a huge store that took up an entire building in New York.
This would make it seem logical that the prices of everything in New York were almost triple those back home.
It was as if the little peaceful neighborhood where I lived was magnified by 100 to make up the wonder city of New York.
My visit to New York City was a life changing experience.
For the first time in my life, I was exposed to a little taste of what the real world is like.
The incredible modes of transportation, the huge skyscrapers, and all of the thousands of people made me anxious to grow up and perhaps move to an incredible city such as this one.
Either way, my first trip to New York was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, one I will always treasure.
FAMILYI cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side.
Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted.
Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.
Whether it’s my grandparent, my two sisters, my mom, or my dad, I know I can always count on someone to help me feel better.
In fact, I think that this is probably the most important thing that my family has taught me;
a family is made up of people who you can trust and who you can count on.
Too many times today, we read in the papers about families where parents abuse their children, verbally and physically.
What these parents don’t realize is that they are either beginning or involving themselves in a vicious circle of hate in families.
When parents abuse their children, they are telling their children that that is the way to raise children, and this is what their children learn.
I was lucky, I have learned differently, because my family cares about me, and I care about them.
In this world of doubt, insecurity, and fear, my family is always there for me, holding their arms open to me with love.
On the first day of first grade, I didn’t want to go to school, I had butterflies in my stomach and I found it difficult to walk because I was so nervous.
The only reason that I finally went into the classroom is because my mom walked in with me, and promised me that as soon as school was out, she’d be there waiting for me, ready to bring me back to where I felt most comfortable, my family.
Luckily, I’m a little more grown up now;
I can go into school by myself, and in a couple of years, when I go away to college, I’ll really have to go to school by myself.
Of course I know I’ll make friends, but none of them will mean as much to me as my family.
It seems like every parent wants their kid to grow up to be a doctor.
but, maybe you really want to!
Being a doctor is all about helping sick people get healthy, and if this sounds like something you want to do, then find out what it takes to follow your dream!
As you know, If you have the flu, you go see the doctor.
If you break your leg from falling down the stairs, you go see the doctor.
If you get sick with something serious like mono or the measles, you go see the doctor.
As you can see, medical doctors do a lot more then wear white coats and carry around stethoscopes.
They help sick people by figuring out what’s wrong with them and giving them the right medicine to get better.
Forget Superman or Spider-Man or any of those other superheroes – doctors are the real heroes cuz they’re the ones who save people’s lives!
Nothing is more rewarding than that.
Most doctors may have to work on evenings and weekends too, and be on call.
That means you have to wear a pager 24/7 and if you get paged, you’ll have to go into work, even if it’s your birthday or a holiday, cuz a sick person needs your help.
Oh, and that’s another downside – you’re always around sick people, which can be pretty depressing.
During my visit to Da Lat last year, I quickly realised why Da Lat was often referred to as a small version of the Netherlands.
The narrow streets there were always filled with blossoming and colorful flowers.
As the locals were preparing for the Flower Festival, most of the streets were decorated with "umbrella inflorescences" made from umbrellas and a lot of bright lights.
These Umbrella inflorescences would be hung next to each other at varying heights ranging from 7 to 9 meters.
In the day time, these umbrellas looked like flowers and at night.
they glowed like splendid flower lanterns.
Both sides of the street had small vendor booths with coffee, tea, wine and street drawings for tourists to enjoy.
Everyday, people would enjoy a street parade with thousands of decorated flowers on various items.
On a vehicle, dancers would wear floral dresses and throw petals to nearby passengers.
Leisurely walking down the street while enjoying all of the colors and smells that thousands of flowers shared with me was my daily activity while I was in Da Lat.
But if you were looking for something more exciting, there were also dozens of exhibitions and trade shows full of flowers, food and drinks, all available for you to explore and enjoy.
I chose to visit the Flowers Market and Food by Flowers festival.
Food made from flowers in Da Lat was not only unique in taste but also was presented in magnificent ways.
I didn’t know that there were so many edible flowers that tasted so great.
I was amazed at how these skillful chefs were able to preserve the original scents and flavors of the flowers after cooking.
every dish looked like a little masterpiece.
Da Lat was also a perfect place for couples on their honeymoon vacation.
They could visit the flower villages in Ha Dong, Thai Phien or Van Thanh, each village would bring them an unique experience.
Ha Dong flower villages still preserved the traditional method of gardening from seedlings with natural fertilizing and harvesting.
while Thai Phien flower village looked like a small industrial zone with sparkling glass houses.
During honeymoon vacation, they could also visit the House of Love, a special flower garden in the Love Valley as well as take a trip to the Immortal Flower Hill in Lament Lake or Gold Flower Hill in Golden Valley.
The temperature in Da Lat was always around 20 degrees Celsius and the weather was often foggy.
The subtle scent of thousands of flowers created a beautiful atmosphere for honeymooners.
Colorful paintings with hundreds of blossoms throughout the area created a romantic look that was indescribable.
The Da Lat flower festival closing ceremony was situated next to Xuan Huong Lake.
There were thousands of visitors that participated in an exciting street dance with nearly 4000 liters of wine served while I was there.
The Wine festival was a feast specially designed to say good-bye to visitors traveling to Da Lat for the flower festival in this mountainous region of Vietnam.
It was an experience I would never forget.
Many years ago, when I was a little child, I admired adventures.
I think that since I breathed in for the first time and felt the ground underneath my feet, when for the very first time I looked at the night sky and its numerous eyes, I wished to live the life of an adventurer.
To explore the jungles, to stride the dessert, to wander through the lost cities and to dive into the deep darkness of the ocean I find extremely exciting.
My wish is to be an adventurer.
To be an adventurer you need some qualities.
You need to know how to get out of some risky and dangerous situations.
You need to know how to survive.
It would also be suggested to know how to sail, because a good sailor is a good adventurer.
What is more, the most epic adventures are found on the sea.
The best thing about going on an adventure is that it is really exciting, filled with thrill and danger.
And, I know it is some kind of cliche, but danger is my middle name.
Another good thing about adventure is the sights you see, the beautiful forests, and the castles.
so many wonderful castles that have numerous ancient tales about knights and dragons.
But like every human has his disadvantages, going on adventures has its bad sides too.
In all the danger and thrill, many have lost their lives.
And so ‘through the darkness and night a beam of light appears and the Dovahkiin comes,’ as the legend says.
One day, a man shall appear and repel all the evil, he will kill all the foes of his land.
But more importantly, he will win, he will conquer all the obstacles and get to his goal.
And, by following his steps, I will become an adventurer for sure.
my mother.
Do you have someone who is great, spends time with you, cares for you, and is an important person?
Well, I do!
she has black hair, brown eyes, and a caring touch.
That’s my mom.
My mom talks to me about many things.
One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up.
She tells me what to do in case of an emergency.
And one day I had a really bad day with my friends, and she told me what to do about it.
My mom and I spend a lot of time together.
We play games, bake cookies, make necklaces, and draw doodle tricks.
But our favorite thing to do is read.
Our favorite book is "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie".
Mom takes me shopping at the mall.
We buy toys and clothes, and we eat at the café.
We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonald’s restaurant.
When we ride the escalator, my mom pretends to fall back and says, "My shoestring’s stuck!".
My mom always laughs, and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy!
She doesn’t laugh every day, but when she does, it’s hilarious, and I have to laugh, too!
My mom is the greatest.
I love how she jokes around.
She is always fun no matter what.
She gives me great advice.
My mom is more than a mom, she is like my best friend!
My hobby is collecting books.
I collect books whenever I have more need for some books.
I collect many kinds of books such a love story books or textbooks I am learning at school, you know, Maths, History, Geography, Biology.
and books about nature.
I buy books from a bookshop near my house, and some other stores.
I also get books from my friends.
I collect books because I would like to learn from books.
They help me broaden my knowledge.
In the future, I try to make my collection larger.
I would open a book store of my own.
This essay on book collecting is intended for potential book collectors and neophytes to this field of collecting and it will likely prove boring to those who are established book collectors and probably to some who are not.
Our intention is to acquaint you with this interesting hobby, to explain the terminology or jargon, and to dispel a few myths or misconceptions.
You can collect in any of a mind-boggling number of areas — this hobby has more variety within it than any other collecting field we can imagine.
You can collect your favorite author.
an author you always wanted-to-read, but- never-had-the-time.
a subject about which you wish to learn more — the American Indian, or the American Indian of the 19th century, or the Blackfoot Tribe or the agriculture of the Algonquins — you can collect recent in-print books, books from the 19th century, books from the first century of printing, paperback books, pulp magazines, fine leather bindings, historic newspapers, pamphlets from the period of the American Revolution or the French Revolution or Vietnam, books printed on mission presses in the Pacific, or even books about book collecting!
Book collecting is expensive!
Not true!
You can spend as little or as much as you are able and willing to spend on your collection.
Some collectors purchase only new in-print books, others buy only at yard sales and library book sales, others visit their neighborhood used book shop, others order only from mail order antiquarian book catalogs, and many are now buying books on the world wide web.
If you are very limited in discretionary funding or very frugal, you could even hold yourself to a maximum of $1.00 (US or the equivalent) per volume by buying at flea markets and yard sales and slowly build an interesting and potentially valuable collection.
Hoi An is an ancient town down the Thu Bon River, on the coastal plain of Quang Nam Province, for about 30 km south of Da Nang City.
Hoi An used to be known as the international market with many different names such as Lam Ap, Faifo, Hoai Pho and Hoi An is the most common one now.
What is special about Hoi An is that this little port town is in an incredible state of preservation.
It includes some of the most densely-concentrated sights in Viet Nam with its old streets which are bordered with ancient houses and assembly halls, its pagodas, temples, ancient wells and tombs.
In total, there are more than a thousand places of interest.
The architecture in Hoi An is characterized by a harmonious blend of Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese culture.
After many centuries, Hoi An is still respectful of its traditions, folk festivals, beliefs and of its sophisticated culinary art.
Located in a quiet environment, Hoi An is surrounded by peaceful villages famous for crafts such as carpentry, bronze making, ceramic.
Researchers said that most of the buildings in Hoi An underwent restoration at the beginning of the 19th century, even if some of them might be constructed long time ago.
The ancient architecture is shown most clearly in the Ancient Town that is located in Minh An Ward.
It covers about 2 square kilometers and almost of all famous relics in Hoi An are gathered here.
The streets are very short and narrow, having a winding, crossing as the chessboard style.
The topography of the ancient town tilt gradually from north to south.
The buildings in the old town are built mostly with traditional materials such as.
brick, wood and no more than two floors.
The trace of time is able to find not only on the architectural design of each building but also everywhere like.
on the yin-yang roof tiles covered with moss and plants.
the old gray mold walls.
the pictures carved on a strange animal, or describing an old story.
Having inherited a multi-cultural architecture which is so varied and sophisticated, Hoi An must have attracted numerous and talented workers in carpentry, ceramics, and woodcarving from China, Japan and other regions of Viet Nam.
For centuries, Hoi An had developed into a melting pot of various nationalities who came to the area, and brought along their own cultures.
Accordingly, Hoi An features the co-existence of indigenous customs and habits and those imported by foreign settlers.
Essay on my trip to Nha Trang cityMy first visit to Nha Trang, a coastal city in Vietnam, was three years ago.
It was a pleasant and memorable trip.
Nha Trang, the Capital of Khanh Hoa province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam.
In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so attractive.
Waves crashing onto the cliffs.
the soft sigh of the sea breeze.
clean white sands and turquoise waters.
it all makes for a marvelous landscapes.
It’s no accident that Nha Trang is often compared to a Mediterranean City.
During my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach – a chance of breathing in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water.
One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands.
Hon Tre is the largest among the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys.
Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests.
Tri Nguyen island is the location of an outdoor aquarium housing more than 400 species of fish, crustaceans and other marine life.
That trip, I spent the whole day roaming the Ponaga Cham towers.
These ancient Hindu temples were built from the 7th to 12th century.
Many of the sandstone statues from this time still remain among the red brick towers, typical of Cham architecture.
Nha Trang is the city in harmony.
its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a certain balance.
Nha Trang is a perfect tourist destination.
As I left, I was reminded of one reason I like the place so much.
I hope to have chance to come back.
I love listening to music, but I am not like other people who often listen to the music that is popular at a time.
The part of music that attracts me is the attitude of the composers and the tone, because the songs represent the writers’ mood and feeling.
Through the songs people can feel what the composers try to express, so I often listen to Jazz, Rock, and R&B.
These three types of music contain different languages but they are all my favorite music styles.
When I really want to relax my body, or to do the exercises at home I will listen to Jazz music.
I do not have the exact time to do exercises, I just play it to release my body.
Jazz music is much faster and more relaxing than pop music.
It makes me want to dance, to do any kind of motion to let go of my body while the music is on.
Sometimes I prefer to do it on my bed.
It is healthy for my body.
My second favorite music style is Rock, which I listen to when I am in a bad mood or lonely.
Rock is very different from Jazz because Rock is quite noisy and contains a lot of screaming.
But the tone of the songs is like magic that can flush all my unhappiness, even though those things are still right there, but at the moment I can feel I have strength to solve problems, and I am not scared of anything anymore.
When I have something to face or have to make a choice, I always listen to Rock music, let the music go through my mind so that I can think deeper and deeper.
I often just sit on the chair and do nothing.
This happened when I am quite tired or sleepy.
for example, sitting on the MRT or buses, I do not think or do anything.
I do not like to be disturbed by others, I want to have my own space.
And R&B music can help me get away from my busy life and clean up my soul.
The three types of music have different functions for me, however, they all bring me happiness and help me get through difficult time.
Hobby is the favourite work or choice which borns spontaneously from inside of a person.
It is very natural and unbiased from external influence.
It attracts us with such an intensity as weleave other more important tasks.
It make us obsessive to become besotted towards our hobby.
Hobby is that which provide peace, happiness and ultimate satisfaction in our life.
Hobbyists should be careful to do their hobby related work in their leisure time only.
Otherwise it would be a murderous to darken one’s fate.
Therefore my suggestion is thatone must be able to judge the value of time in various phases of life.
It has been noticed that a student destroyed his carrier by devoting fully on his hobby of Guitar playing.
Our like and dislike don’treflect our strength or weakness.
There must be a fine balance between our lifestyle and performance.
Music listening is my hobby.
Music is a common name that has encapsulated various kind of songs e.g.
patriotic song, religious, classical music.
The list is endless.
My mother says, when I was at the age of seven years, I was more interested to listen songs.
Also I showed reflection of singing ability in those days.
Still at this age it fits to my nature.
I love to listen songs because I feel a sense of accomplishment.
I can isolate myself from the crowd and I can pass my time with full entertainment.
It gives me new energy.
It reduces my stresses.
While listening music, I feel out of world.
I seldom hesitate to spend for my hobby.
In past time it was a dream to have a good quality music system for me.
On that time l prmished myself to buy a costly music system when I would get money.
Almighty listened my wish and now I am blessed with such a level of earning that I can buy any music system to quench thirst of my hobby.
Before Tet, people should return all the things that they have borrowed from others and pay all the debts they owed.
It is believed that people should never start a new year with debts and borrowed things.
otherwise in that year people would be stuck with debts.
On the first day of Tet, adults (those who have already got married and have income) are supposed to prepare some "lucky money" to give the children and kids when visiting other’s homes as a symbol of luck for the coming New Year.
People are also supposed to say best wishes to others.
These activities are done with the expectation that luck and good things are brought to everyone.
Gift-exchanging is another common custom during Tet holiday, which is used mostly in business.
The process of giving and receiving gifts help to enhance the relationships between clients and firms.
The popular presents are cookies, chocolates, fruit baskets, wine, soft drinks or other kinds of treats.
Usually, people can buy a pack of gifts in the shops which includes many different kinds of food.
If you have a Vietnamese business partner, take this opportunity to enhance the relationships.
Tet is a special occasion that people wear new and beautiful outfits.
The streets during Tet is full with colorful dresses, ao dai and other costumes.
It is thought that colorful bright colors like red, yellow or blue can bring good luck and prosperity to people for the upcoming year.
Another essential element of Tet is smiles.
A smile can make everything seem more relaxing and enhance relationship among people.
A smile can bring joy and happiness to you as well as people around you for the whole year also.
During this Tet, people refrain themselves from getting angry or depressed and put an instant smile on their faces, hoping for a happy new year.
Technology is now a big part of our society and our predictable future.
There is little room for people who wish to live without technology, and luckily, it is still advancing at a rate that has helped stave off stagnation.
I believe that for every advantage that technology brings us, it also brings us a disadvantage at the same time.
Smartphones enable people to stay in touch, even over long distances, and they are relatively safe and reliable to use.
There are devices that people can use to communicate with plus at the other end of the planet and getting and keeping in touch with other people is very easy.
The disadvantages of smartphone is that it means people no longer need to meet in person as much, and interpersonal relationships are suffering worldwide because people are communicating through a small handheld device.
A lot of people have smartphones and they use them almost semi-continuously, including in public settings when they could be making new friends, finding new lovers, and interacting with their current friends.
The advantages of the internet are that people can communicate over vast distances and can gain access to information and get answers to their questions very quickly.
The disadvantage is that the Internet isn’t moderated in the way that people think and lots of it is filled with misinformation and outright lies.
Even brand-named websites which have a lot of trust are not accountable for what appears on their own websites.
Even respected and branded news sites have stories that have passed through many people’s hands and originally started as lies with zero accountability throughout the dissemination process.
In conclusion, technology brings about such a lot of advantages.
However, it’s people’s duty to use it in an appropriate way to make it beneficial.
The job that I have is also the same as the job that I have always wanted to have.
I’m an English teacher, and I also run a website called DailyStep.
com, so that I can teach English to many more people than I could teach in one classroom.
Different aspects of my job involve different skills.
When it comes to teaching, the job involves, of course, teaching students for general and business English, and so on.
This requires a detailed knowledge of grammar, syntax, business skills such as presentations and meetings and more.
The website side involves other skills, many of which I have had to acquire as I went along.
I have to write dialogues for lessons, produce blogs, answer emails, record audio files, maintain the content on the website, and liaise with technical developers on website improvements I have suggested.
Of course, I also have to deal with day to day problems as they arise.
I chose the job of English teacher after several years working as a researcher and journalist, as English is my first love and my passion.
I really enjoy explaining things in a concise and clear way too.
When I was a child, I used to like games such as organizing words into categories, and I think perhaps the kick I get from explaining grammar well is an extension of that.
I’m interested in this job for so many reasons.
As I mentioned, I love the English language.
I am also fascinated to learn about people and their life stories, and in this job I meet a huge variety of people from all over the world.
I’m keen to help bridge the divides between cultures.
when people speak a common language, and can communicate, then perhaps they can start to understand each other better in other ways too.

In the future I want to become a fashion designer.
My goal is to create clothes for all sizes, ages, and genders.
In my clothing I want to show a creative side of my artistic ability and I want to make my clothing affordable for all as well.
I think I want to become a fashion designer because I have a passion for art.
I enjoy making sketches of clothing that I hope one day will be available in stores all over the world.
Fashion designing, to me, is a way to express the unique side of your creativity.
This is also a career that I believe I can achieve if I stay focused and continue to put effort in my creations.
I find interior designing as a possible career in my future since it’s somewhat similar to fashion designing.
Both involve having a sense of style and an eye for color, texture and pattern coordination.
In order to prepare for this career in my future I need to attend a college involving designing, fashion designing, and a type of art.
The qualification I would need would be a two to four-year college for fashion designing and a one to three-year college for interior designing.
These careers require a bachelor’s degree in some place of art.
So as to attend college, first of all I have to maintain an acceptable grade point average which is 2.5 or higher depending on the location of the college as well as the level of the skill learning of the college.
It is undoubtedly the case that cities around the world increasingly suffer from congestion.
In this essay, I will examine the reasons leading to this trend and suggest some practical policies the authorities could implement to reduce the level of traffic in our cities.
The first step is to understand why traffic has increased in cities.
Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons for this.
The third reason is that society has in general become more mobile and this means more people are prepared to commute to work by car than they were before.
There is almost certainly no one who can propose solution to this problem given the complexity of its causes.
However, one option has to be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take buses or the trains rather than get in their cars.
It would also be possible to discourage people from driving to work by introducing special tariffs for using the roads, especially during rush hours.
A successful example of this is the congestion charge scheme in London which has certainly reduced the level of traffic in inner-city areas.
In conclusion, there are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas.
While it may not be possible to find a complete solution, any action should probably involve encouraging greater use of public transport and making it more expensive for the motorist to drive in urban areas.
The job of a pilot is a very hard and risky, but prestigious one.
Pilots travel thousands of kilometers a day and they can find themselves in different time and climate zone.
They can see all parts of the world and get to know new people where they arrive.
But a pilot also faces some problems.
They often suffer from jet lag and can easily become tired when being in different time zones.
They have to spend many days away from home and their families.
Even though many people think it is a real dream job, pilots must be responsible for other people because they hold the lives of a few hundred passengers in their hands.
They are required to have hundreds of hours of training before that.
Pilots must remain calm in dangerous situations and always have to make the right decisions.
They also need to see and hear perfectly.
Many people believe that pilots are paid a lot of money.
It is true for pilots who work for a big airline company, smaller budget ones cannot afford to pay their pilots that much.
In today’s world, airlines are competing fiercely for their market shares.
As a result, pilots may lose their jobs if airlines decide to cut costs.
Sharing is a good way of living in modern society.
Sharing, literally, means showing concerns and empathy towards other people.
.
The sharing is expressed in many ways, which can be very small actions such as encouragement, comforting words, holding hands or loving eyes.
sharing has a very important role in life.
No one lives without the sharing of others.
Life is always full of difficulties and no one knows what to expect.
Sometimes, we need to share so that we can get motivation to move on.
The sharing is not a figurative thing.
Sometimes, just a small action is enough.
Sharing is not difficult, all it needs is an act from the bottom of your heart.
What will you get in return for you share?
The answer is love.
If you want to receive, firstly, you have to learn how to give and to share.
Life not only has material value but also needs sincere feelings.
sharing and empathy will bring you wonderful things and make your life better.
People often say "the coldest place is not the North Pole, but the place where there is no love." Life is giving and receiving.
So, why not give love to receive love back?
In my freetime, I like to dance.
I know that for some people dancing is not considered a true hobby.
but the way I see it, if I enjoy dancing and spend my precious time doing it, then I have every right to consider it as my special hobby.
Dancing was just my thing.
As far as I can remember about my childhood, right after I learned to walk, I have always loved to dance and I began to dance around the house all the time.
My mom put me in dance school when I was three years old.
I would learn so quickly that the instructor would sometimes ask me to help her teach the other students.
My first dance show was at school festival when I was five years old.
Becoming a famous dancer was one of my greatest childhood dreams.
It is hard to define the actual start of dancing.
Dancing has been around for too long that people can’t remember.
Dancing is a category of art that is popular worldwide, streaming through every country in many forms.
Everyone can dance in their own way so it is easy to get started with this hobby.
Dancing requires both physical and mental tenacity.
This is difficult in the face of a highly competitive atmosphere and the pressures of a busy academic and social life.
However, my passion and love for it have made all of these struggles worth it.
Dancing was a hobby that I always will love.
My love of dance has always served as an inspiration for me.
I dance from my heart and always strive to do my best.
My father is a lovely father of the world.
He is my real hero, my best friend, my inspiration in my life.
He is the person who helps me a lot in getting prepared for the school, getting rise of the bed and having my homework done well.
He always cares for me and calls my mom in the afternoon just to know that whether I arrive home from school at right time or not.
He is very healthy, fit, happy, peaceful and punctual person.
He always goes to the office on time and also teaches us to go to school at right time.
He teaches us the value of time in life and says that if one wastes his/her time, time ruins his/her life.
He is a very nice person and helps my neighbors in their difficult time.
He always loves, cares and respects my mom and never quarrels with her.
He always supports her and sometimes, he helps in the kitchen during her illness.
He respects and loves my grandparents and teaches us to take care of them.
He tells us that old people are like God for us, we should care, love and respect them.
We should never avoid the old in their difficult time as this time comes in everyone’s life once.
He tells us that we should always help needy people of any age group all through the life according to our status.
He takes 15 minutes of us every day to tell us about the ethics and other good habits.
Every teacher devotes all his or her life to education.
It usually isn’t because of the money or the three-month summer vacation.
Reasons for becoming a teacher are deeper than that, and while they are personal, they are almost all united by the desire to impact peoples’ lives.
One reason to become a teacher is to influence the education system.
If you recognize the need to improve the quality of education in your country, then you may become a teacher to make change.
There is a lot of work to be done, but it is the collective effort of thousands of dedicated teachers that will make the most difference.
Another reason for becoming a teacher is to make contribution to your community in a meaningful way.
Teaching is one of the most direct ways to make an impact, and if you are driven by the desire to help people around you, being a teacher is an invaluable contribution.
Teachers do more than teaching, and their impact extends far beyond the classroom.
As a teacher, you are more than just an educator because you are a mentor, a confidant and a friend.
One of the most common reasons to become a teacher is to make a difference in the lives of as many students as possible.
Teachers have more chances to interact with students at all stages of development and from all walks of life.
A great teacher always wants to help students along their path and to play a part in shaping the person they hope to become.
Becoming a teacher lets you impart life lessons that they will never forget and puts you in a position to influence their decisions, behaviors, strengths, weaknesses and imaginations.
Essentially, becoming a teacher lets you take part in shaping the next generation.
What’s your hobby?
Reading books, listening to music, shopping.
or feeding cats like me.
The biggest hobby I like is feeding cats.
I guess that many people will have this hobby like me, especially girls.
Cats are dutiful, cute and very easy to feed.
Since I was 10, I have been interested in having a cat, and my father gave me a white cat as a gift to celebrate the 11th birthday.
I cried so much, because of happiness, and I promised that I will take care of him carefully.
And now, I’m 18 years old, I still raise this cat.
Every day in the morning, I usually feed him, and then I go to school, and he stays at home.
In the afternoon, I take him for a walk with my mother.
About 2 – 3 days, I just take him to have a bath, because, he is scared of water.
In the winter, I really like to buy clothing for my cat to make him warm, and this is the best thing I like.
Next time, I prepare to have a lady cat from my grandma, so I feel happy and look forward to this moment.
And you, do you love cats like me?
Mountains always have a great fascination for men and people, particularly the rich go to the mountains to escape from the noise of the life below.
Mountain climbing, however, is not without risks.
It is a challenge to the unconquerable spirit of a man and his love of adventure.
That this is a dangerous sport cannot be denied.
When one climbs higher and higher, breathing becomes more and more difficult.
Some climbers, therefore, carry a heavy apparatus on their back from which they inhale oxygen.
Mountain climbing is extremely dangerous.
There are snow storms and blizzards.
It is troublesome to walk through the snow.
It is still more difficult to climb on ice because it is hard to keep foothold and cut steps with axes so as to make progress.
The cold is so severe that the climber’s feet, toes and fingers may suffer from frostbite.
The most serious difficulty is that the climber at a high altitude gets exhausted with a little effort.
Mountain climbing requires proper training, skill and knowledge.
The climbers must be well equipped.
They must be in good physical condition and should have courage, perseverance and power of endurance.
They should carry with them maps, compasses and other equipment in order that they are able to find out where they are in the absence of any, tracks.
The climbers take with them packs loaded with first-aid supplies, food and extra clothing for sudden changes of weather.
They display the spirit of sportsmanship and fellow-feeling and face the severe risks of life undaunted.
Mountain climbing is a thrilling but manly adventure.
It brings into playing the heroic qualities of man.
Mountaineers deserve all praise for their courage and heroism.
Ho Chi Minh City is one of the biggest cities in the south of Vietnam, which provides people with a great number of various jobs.
Therefore, people from many different parts of the country keep on moving to this city, hoping to find out their ‘paradise’.
For those who have been living in this city for a long time, more than 10 years for example, their ‘used-to-be paradise’ is getting worse and worse.
Its increasing crime and disorder also makes Ho Chi Minh City a worse place to live in today than ten years ago.
A number of the city dwellers, especially young illiterate guys of lower social classes, cannot earn their living legally.
They allow themselves to rob or steal anything they can to satisfy their needs, irrespective of how serious the consequences of their frightening acts are.
Pollution is the first thing that makes Ho chi Minh City a worse place to live in.
Its drainage system has been overbooked to drain for a city of over seven million people nowadays.
Consequently, the so-called ‘the pearl of the Far East’ is getting more and more polluted.
Water pollution is only part of the pollution facing all the dwellers of this biggest city in Vietnam.
The air pollution here is no less serious.
Thousands of factories are still located inside this city and keep on releasing poisonous smoke.
Various means of transportation, especially millions of motorcycles, do contribute to the ever-increasing air pollution in Ho Chi Minh city.
It is invariably true that every person who is knowledgeable leads a successful life.
Knowledge is very important tool to get positive changes in the society and country.
Knowledge helps us to absorb things from the genius people which have potential to improve the quality of life.
Knowledge is the only precious thing which nobody can take away from us.
It gives new and revolutionary ideas which help to alter the way of viewing the world.
So, we can say that knowledge is pillar to the success and happiness.
Knowledge helps us to convert our planning into the right action and enables to get the difference between right or wrong and good or bad.
It helps us to overcome our weaknesses and faults as well as makes us able to face the dangers and difficulties by giving lots of courage and confidence.
It makes a person more powerful by giving him mental, moral and spiritual advancement in the life.
Human beings are physically weaker than animals yet they have managed things for years to become the most powerful creature on earth.
Because they get power from knowledge and are independent on the physical strength.
Human beings are clever creature of nature, they have ability to acquire knowledge and preserve their knowledge, research and experiences in the books in order to pass to the new generations.
Knowledge gives them power to know how to control the forces of nature and then use them for getting benefited.
Knowledge is a most strong tool which cannot be defeated by other power on the earth.
Knowledge provides social power to person holding certain power over those people who do not.
Obtaining knowledge helps to address various difficulties in life.
Cats as pets have become far more familiar with mankind community, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations.
However, although problems regarding cats’ hair may affect the health conditions of people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally, are clearly undeniable.
In term of physical benefits, the well-being with cats are more favorable compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take after themselves, the responsibility to ensure their love one being fed and well taken care of makes them to become even more active.
Owing to these extra activities, this though might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad lifestyles.
Coupled with physical side, their mental aspect will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the feeling of loneliness.
Therefore, their depressing rate could be minimized.
Despite the above advantages, the threats of too close interaction between cats and vulnerable people still exist.
One of the major concerns is the harmfulness of their hairs on their owner, especially those with asthma.
Because of the virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets.
In addition, old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, because their health conditions are limited, which could become even more challenging when they try to take care of others.
In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic outweigh its shortages.
For these reasons, instead of discontinuing them, further support would be far more beneficial.
Nowadays, teamwork is an essential element of the society.
We all work with people everyday.
A co-worker is a person with whom we work closely and share tasks.
In my opinion, the important characteristics of a co-worker should be as followed.
First of all, an important character of a co-worker should be reliability.
As we often have to encounter a lot of problems at work, it is a good thing to work with someone that we can always count on.
A reliable co-worker can help us with problems that we cannot solve by ourselves.
Also, if we happen to be absent from work, a reliable co-worker can always backup what we have been working on and make correct decisions even without us.
Last of all, another important character of a co-worker should be responsibility.
Indeed, no one would want an irresponsible person as his or her co-worker.
It would be a nightmare if your co-worker does not do anything and leave everything for you to finish.
On the other hand, a responsible co-worker not only do his own part of work, but also, as soon he finishes his own, helps you finish yours, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the work.
A responsible co-worker can help others work more efficiently by giving others aid in addition to getting their part of job done.
To summarize, as I have stated above, a good co-worker should be reliable and responsible.
A co-worker that possesses these characteristics can certainly help enhance the progress of work and benefits his or her colleagues as well.
Violin is one of the rare instruments that you can learn at a very young age, as they make very small student versions, and so at the age of 10 I began to learn to play violin.
Learning violin was a lot of fun to me due to the great teachers in the class, and now that my parents knew that I needed to stay interested so as to keep progressing.
Following the traditional path, I started with group violin lessons rather than individual violin lessons.
I didn’t even start with a real violin.
we all had boxes that were wrapped in brown paper!
A ruler was taped to the end of the box to simulate a fingerboard, and our "bow" was the cardboard tube from a clothes hanger.
Therefore, my very first lessons on how to play violin were actually about how to stand, how to hold the violin, and how to make the proper movements in unison with the teacher and the other kids.
It didn’t take long for me to earn the privilege of unwrapping my box and receiving a real violin.
And soon my violin lessons, along with daily practice with my parents, became part of the family routine.
I know now that to learn to play violin, you need to be drawn to the sound of the violin.
You’re going to be hearing that sound a lot, so it’s very crucial to have some connection there from the start!
You will need someone who can show you proper setup at the beginning, since there are so many dead ends and blind alleys related to postures and positioning that are very hard to overcome without help.
And you also need someone around you who can motivate you and keep you accountable on a regular basis.
It’s best if this person is a violin teacher, someone who can assess your progress regularly.
Why learn to play violin instead of other instruments?
Because the violin is so versatile!
You can play alone, choosing among hundreds of years’ worth of solo repertoire from composers as diverse as Bach, Paganini, Bartok or John Adams.
You can play with a friend who has a piano, or with three in a string quartet.
You can also play in a string orchestra or a full orchestra.
And there are many more community orchestras than professional ones so that anybody that wants to play in a group has a chance.
The discipline and love of the violin sound will take you anywhere you want to go.
If you’ve been thinking about learning to play violin, don’t wait any longer!
Find a violin, get it a check-up, and get someone to show you the basis.
Then don’t let anything stand in your way.
Because of the deep penetration of the Internet across the world, it would indeed be a big problem if the ‘Internet plug’ was pulled out from our lives.
We have become dependent on the Internet for most of the things we want to do such as learning, shopping, socializing, or entertaining ourselves.
It has become a way of life for many of us.
In the absence of the Internet, the implications would be devastating.
The impact of having no Internet on your overall living style would depend upon how often you use it, and what you use it for.
If you were an Internet addict, you would find that your life has come to a screeching halt.
People use the Internet to stay connected to our friends and family.
If you had gotten very used to socializing online, you would now be clueless as to how you could share those pictures of your recent trip you went for, with your friends spread across the globe.
It would be difficult to meet and interact with people living outside your locality.
With no way to communicate using emails, instant messaging, chat, or social media, we would have to resort to those old ways of communicating with people.
We would have to resort to the option of a face-to-face interaction, telephone conversation, or sending and receiving snail mail.
The Internet has become a gigantic sea of information and resources.
No Internet would mean no instant and easy access to information at the click of a button.
You would have to walk down to your local library and actually search the whole place to get the information you are looking for, with little chances that you will find what you seek instantly.
Students who were in the habit of using the Internet for completing their assignments and projects will have a tough time figuring out an alternative.
To sum up, the Internet now plays an important role in our daily life.
If there were no its existence, you couldn’t read this example essay.
Playing sport is necessary because it brings about physical strength and mental power to the person involved in this on regular basis.
Outdoor sports such as football, cricket, volleyball, hockey, running, help in improving physical health and mental fitness.
However, some indoor games and sports like brain games, chess, Sudoku.
improve mental power and concentration level.
Sports and games are very beneficial to us as they teach us punctuality, patient, discipline, teamwork and dedication.
Being involved in the sports activities helps us in getting protected with numerous diseases such as arthritis, obesity, heart problems, diabetes.
It teaches us to go ahead in life by removing all the weaknesses.
It makes us bold and gives the feeling of happiness by reducing the occurrence of anxiety and angry.
My favourite subject in high school is English.
I not only want to become fluent in foreign language but also desire to deeply understand the beauty of this language.
In my opinion, English is one of the most powerful tools that exists nowadays to communicate to other people.
It makes easier to make friends around the world.
By using english, we can explore the world in a deeper way.
Thanks to this language, I can understand more about different cultures.
I am the kind of person who love traveling.
Therefore, it’s essential to master in English if you want to communicate to the local people.
In addition, you won’t feel lost in the middle of a city because you can ask the natives for help.
It was such an amazing method of communication when I travelled in Japan, French or Korea without knowing the local languages.
Furthermore, I believe that English helps a lot to get access to the latest information about scientific topics such as Economics, which by the way was my major at university.
If you want to be at the forefront in your professional field, nothing is better than reading the different articles.
Whilst, most of them are written in English.
In conclusion, I think that there are many reasons to learn English because of it’s benefits.
If you really fall in love with English, you will never want to give up it for any reasons.
Everyone always has expectation to be rich or to have his or her own company.
Some people dream of becoming leaders, politicians and famous stars.
There are others who are interested in becoming poets, writers and novelists while most of us generally have a desire of becoming engineers, doctors and scientists of great repute.
It is not easy to choose a career that is suitable or relevant to your major today.
Hundreds of students are leaving schools and universities every year to seek employment in the various professions, though employment opportunities are not increasing proportionately.
As a result, the rate of unemployment is increasing rapidly every year.
Before graduating from school or university, you may have many plans and be confident that choosing a career will not be difficult.
However, after graduation, you will find that there are others with better qualifications waiting to enter the same position.
It means that the job which you are willing to follow, could be taken by others.
In reality, many employees are working in the fields that are not actually relevant to his or her major in schools.
In conclusion, I believe that the dream of becoming a mill-owner or a multi­millionaire can become true or turn out to be nothing.
However, following a career sometimes is just a life of simplicity and goodness devoted to the service of humanity.
Before any decisions to career, you should remember that.
the motto of this life is ‘simple living and high satisfaction.
Sport is a very important thing in our life.
It plays a vital role in keeping our health safe as well as contributing in human personality.
Some of these sports are dangerous like high-speed motor racing.
Many people prefer this dangerous sports and keep practicing regularly.
There are several reasons why many people like motor racing.
The large amount of income and an astonishing fame allowing them to become a global celebrity are some of the main reasons which in turn lead to adrenalin rush among the sport professionals to participate in unsafe sporting activities.
The racing drives are those who daily undergo such high risk conditions, for instance, however, they are willing to do it repeatedly due to the rewards they receive through this.
I think they love to do so because they may feel a sort of lack of confidence, so they try to maintain this point by doing these dangerous sports.
The most striking feature, in my opinion, is the stress in addition to the negative energy that many people have, they need to get rid of their stress by practicing racing.
I tend to see that, these racers should be trained well by professional coaches before they start playing motor racing to minimize any danger that may occur during this practice.
Also, some restrictions should be done for this sport and it should be related to age, as the small children and young ages should be prevented from practicing this kind of sports because they may still young to deal with their dangerous.
Today if there is any institution which has the greatest influence on us after the family, it is the school.
The time that we spend in school are not only time spent in learning and filling our minds with knowledge, but also time spent forming our character, acquiring various attitudes and imbibing basic principles of life.
The basic traits of our personality are formed during our school days.
The name of my school is Nguyen Binh Khiem High School.
It is situated in the suburb of Hai Phong city.
It is considered to be one of the finest schools in the city, highly acclaimed for its excellent for number of talented students.
The school building is an impressive structure.
It consists of four three – floor blocks and has about 36 classrooms.
Classrooms are spacious and airy.
Two staircases at both ends lead to the floors.
The school has a well-equipped library, a well- established science laboratory and two excellent computer room, all of which are situated on the a separate block.
There is an area for learning physical education and sports.
Two cemented basketball courts stand in the right corner, while the school’s football field is in the center of the area.

I am proud to be a student of Nguyen Binh Khiem High school.
People tend to believe that they can only achieve happiness in life by following their "dreams", doing things they really love to do and ignoring any other factors.
In fact, happiness is not something you can measure and evaluate.
Happiness is fluid, flexible and it differs from people to people.
Happiness is unlike a goal which has concrete meaning and limit.
A goal you set can be clearly seen by other people.
However, happiness is something only you can define byyourself.
It is not a goal to achieve, rather it is a feeling you have.
The fluffy and little pleasure you have in your life is what make you happy.
A dream, in the other hand, is more complex and goal-like.
You dream to be a successful business man or a celebrity singer.
You have goals which are long-term and enormous.
However, in most cases, you just dream to be someone else rather than being that person in reality.
This is what we call fantasy dream.
To put it simple, that is an illusion you create to escape from your boring and depressing daily routine.
It has relationwith having the happiness you really want.
The happiness you need is always around you, in your own boring life.
Asking yourself this question to discover your true happiness in life.
what make you feel content, pleasant and thankful.
People blame for their own jobs, hate their devastated state of life they have, but normally forget the small grateful, and serene moments that calm their fluctuating heart.
Remember your favorite songs you repeatedly listen to.
Remember the warm and cozy dinner your mom has made for you after a long, busy day at work.
They can be just small, trivia things in your life but they surely serve you well.
What you are waiting for not in the illusion of becoming someone else, but enjoying your life to its utmost.
My long-term objective is to start up an English Centre by 2020, which will be the first one in Vietnam targeting at Economics students.
The centre, following a four-level structure, will aim at cultivating integrated English skills for learners to facilitate their academic study and research at universities, inspiring them to learn English with endeavour and renovate their own self-studying methods.
Furthermore, learners will also benefit from practical internship opportunities at the centre, as active students will be selected for short-term non-profit training programs and directly involved in organizing quarterly English events under mentors’ guidance.
Through gaining first-hand experience in particular projects, they will also actively boost their pool of soft skills, a key criterion in the recruitment policies of both multinational and domestic enterprises nowadays.
Human beings are designed in such a way that they are in constant need of love, care as well as affection during all times in their lives.
This is the reason why we seek for companionship at each and every point in our life.
We make friends and maintain a closely knit relationship with them because friends not only take away the feeling of void from your life.
they also make us feel secure and accompanied as an individual.
Friendship is considered to be a true blessing for everyone and a person with good friends will have a support system for sharing each and every moment of their life whether it is happy or sad.
I have seen friendships going on for several years and sometimes even for a lifetime with people constantly taking care of each other and maintaining a bond based on trust and care.
Especially for people living away from their homes, friends are nothing short of their family.
Often known as "siblings from different mothers," friends keep us grounded as well as also help us retain the child in us no matter how old we get or how busy we are in leading our professional as well as personal lives.
They are the ones you can run up to in times of any crisis as well as during the happy moments of your life.
Friends are our secret keepers with whom we can share everything without the fear of being judged.
The world might go through a tremendous change but friends are the people we can rely on no matter what.
At times, we may come across situations where we doubt our decisions as well as capabilities.
In situations like these, friends help us by providing us with a reality check.
They never let us down and stand besides us like a rock.
True friends show faith in us and also make us believe in our capabilities keeping aside all negative feelings of jealousy, agony and hatred.
Friends simply do not care if the fault is yours or not, they will stand by you during all times.
They will never stop defending you or putting their trust in you.
They could have seen us in the ugliest of situations and appearances and they simply do not care about these things and still decide to stick by us through every thick and thin.
In conclusion, it can be depressing for each one of us to live alone at times.
In such times, friends become our ultimate support system and they are our cure for loneliness and depression.
Always keeping each others’ back, friends are everything that we need for making our lives beautiful and content.
What makes a creative leader?
Creativity, as an intangible quality, is difficult to describe in fundamental terms.
Likewise, leadership is another virtue that cannot be easily qualified as the impacts of true leadership are far-ranging and difficult to measure.
Couple these two qualities together and what you get is an exceptionally abstract concept that becomes even more challenging to qualify.
Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things.
They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new.
The ability to come up with new ideas is a defining characteristic of creative leaders.
They’re able to step out of the common view and imagine new possibilities that set the course for others to follow.
Creative Leaders anticipate failure.
They eliminate fear of failure to encourage more innovative ideas.
They are not perfectionists who never get it wrong or, worse still.
They are also not the conservatives who never take a risk.
Leadership is a mindset in action.
So don’t wait for the title.
Leadership isn’t something that anyone can give you—you have to earn it and claim it for yourself.
Each of us has a tremendous capacity for becoming a creative leader as we are unique.
Volunteer is one of Vietnam’s long-standing activities contributing effectively to community development, capacity building and poverty reduction.
Volunteer activities are taking place vibrantly with every passing day, not only do they bring positive results from specific volunteer programs but they also conduce to generate and raise awareness for a large number of people in Vietnam.
The key point of volunteer activities is a part of a global effort to ensure that every child has access to a quality education – it’s a direct route out of poverty.
In addition, the activities will be the main distributor of connecting the people, improving the living standard, and helping the poor around countries.
However, the volunteer activities of Vietnam are very diverse in both content and form.
In fact, these volunteer activities remain separate and spontaneous.
information on volunteer activities is not accessible with majority seeking information about specific volunteer programs that interest them due to the lack of coordinating network among volunteer clubs and organizations.
With a tradition of solidarity and compassion, all Vietnamese people profoundly understand that, to rise from a low starting point, each individual has to make every effort to promote internal strength by volunteering to help the needy and contribute to the development of communities and country.
Water shortage is a big concern for many countries around the world.
Drinking water protection is the responsibility of both individuals and governments.
Everyone plays key role in trying to protect the supply of water.
Water is a vital necessity that all people need in order to survive.
Without water, people could only live a few days before having serious health problems or even death.
Many people believe that the use of water should be restricted in some way.
There can be no doubt that there is a limited supply of fresh water, although some parts of the world feel this more acutely than others.
The high rate of populations around the world where fresh water is already severely scarce might lead governments to the firm decision that they should impose restrictions on how water should be used and how much of it each person should be permitted to use.
Whilst I can see that this resolution from government has a certain logic, I think that strict controls are not the final answer.
This severe problem need to be resolved by different ways.
This can be done by building more desalination plants.
However, this is very expensive and some countries could not afford to do this.
Another possibility is to educate people how to use the source of fresh water properly.
Another solution is to protect existing water supplies like underground supplies and take steps to prevent them becoming polluted.
Also, recycled water could be used for irrigating farms.
In conclusion, I believe that governments should ensure that all citizens have sufficient access to fresh water and price it – or allow it to be priced – according to supply and demand.
Besides, all citizens should have full responsibility of protecting the supply of fresh water.
Nowadays, large cities are becoming more and more inhabited because of the tendency of the immigration to the city.
Even though, it brings about many advantages such as more opportunities of jobs and higher living standard, the urban lifestyle make rural dwellers opt to live a different lifestyle than before.
Living in a big city may result in many drawbacks as discussed following.
Urban centers are filled with motorized transport and other sources of pollutants like waste from the large populations of people, or emissions from factories.
The urban centers have very few or even totally missing green spaces with higher amount of pollutants that are so harmful for citizens.
For a long time, lung cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma are just a few diseases common among urban dwellers.
Another disadvantage of living in a city is traffic congestion.
Every day, many people have to struggle with the transportation jams, who usually face with being late in their office.
They are always stuck for many hours on the way to work.
In addition, more transports on the street are the main distributor of air pollution which can lead to many bad effects on man’s health.
It is undeniable that the cost of living in big cities is much higher than in countryside.
The impact of this can result in the expensive cost of the public services such as health service, postal service, education.
It will be difficult for the poor and workers to live in big cities with a low minimum wage.
They seem to struggle with the rapid changes in the price of basic necessities and public services like hospitals, schools.
Ao Dai the a traditional dress of Vietnam.
It is one of the symbols of Vietnam.
When one hears about Vietnam, the word "Ao Dai" will most probably be mentioned.
Early versions of the "Ao Dai" date back to 1744 when Lord Vu Vuong of the Nguyen Dynasty decided both men and women should wear an outfit of pants and a gown that buttoned down the front.
What wasn’t, until 1930 that "Ao Dai"appear similar to what it looks today.
Now, Men wear it less, generally only on ceremonial occasions such as weddings or funerals.
During the 1950s two tailors in Saigon started producing "Ao Dai" with raglan sleeves.
This creates a diagonal seam running from the collar to the underarm.
This style is still preferred today"Ao Dai" is made individually to fit each customer’s shape to create the most flattering look.
Its body-hugging top flows over wide trousers that brush the floor.
The pants should reach the soles of the feet and flow along the floor.
Comfortability is always taken into account for fashions and beauty.
Tailors must be skills so as to ensure the wearer has freedom of movement.
Despite it being a long robe, "Ao Dai" is cool to wear.
Synthetic or silk fabrics are best to use because they do not crush and dry quickly.
For this reason "Ao Dai" is a practical uniform for daily wear.
The color can show the wearer’s age and status.
Young girls wear pure white, fully-lined outfits symbolizing their purity.
Older but unmarried girls move into soft pastel shades.
Only married women wear "Ao Dai" in strong, rich colors, usually over white or black pants.
"Ao Dai"is rarely seen in places where manual work is practiced.
In the nineties the Ao dai become popular again.
It has become standard and common attire for female students as well and staff at offices and hotels.
Ao dai nowadays is very popular with different designs and colors.
"Ao Dai"has become the most preferred dress for formal occasions and traditionally ceremonies.
Today, "Ao Dai" has been modified.
Its length is cut shorter usually just below the knee.
Variations in the neck, between boat and mandarin style, are common.
Access to new fabrics have made for some interesting design most visitors to Vietnam admire local tailors’ skills when making ao dai.
It is hard to think of a more elegant, demure and charming outfit, that suits Vietnamese women of different ages, than Ao Dai.
Consumers in many countries are encouraged to consume more products.
From an economic perspective, there is a constructive culprit of development for production, whilst there is a pervasive anxiousness about the adverse impact of shopaholic tendency on the society.
If a greater demand for products is stimulated, the production will be developed to meet this market needs.
The decision of manufacturers is affected by the capacity of consumption for products which is the key contributor to their profits.
Consumers are favorable with their products, thereby an increase in their profits induces to the extending production scales.
For example, Vietnamese noodle corporations, in recent years, have diversified and developed their products thanks to the high demand for instant noodle.
On the other hand, through an increasingly more materialistic mentality along with mass marketing, citizens are getting addicted to shopping.
Instead of exerting their spending efficiently, they are willing to afford to new products which following by trend.
The majority of them have struggled with overspending that triggers to their burden of debt.
Moreover, shopaholic tendency can predispose to break off their responsibility.
For example, their responsibility of mothers for ensuring a balanced and nutritious diet for their kids by home cooked meals will be replaced with habit of buying fast food owing to the available to the convenient food in stores or restaurants.
In conclusion, benefits of encouraging consumption for efficient production from economic perspectives are undeniable.
However, uncontrolled spending and debt as well as bad habits are negative of this trend.
There are many valuable things in life, but friendship may be one of the most important.
A friend may be defined as.
" a person whom you know, like and trust".
But to all, friendship has no clearly defined terminology.
The definition of a friend, and friendship, is based upon our own notions.
True friendship is a feeling of love, sharing and caring.
It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are, without any exaggeration, flattery and pretensions.
It gives a feeling that you are "unique" and that you are "someone" and not a faceless being in the crowd.
A true friend stands by you through thick and thin.
Lasting friendship is indeed, a blessing.
Good friends are great pillars of life.
They help us to stand tall and erect in life.
Friendship can make or break us.
It can lead to good careers and proper living.
It does not matter how often you meet your friends, but how much you care and feel for another in good times as well as in bad times.
True friendship is a great asset in life.
Friends are needed in every stage of life.
Friendship has no age limit.
Every group of people-children, youth, elders, very elderly people, have their friends.
Famous saying states that.
To live life without the experience of friendship, is life without living.
My mother is the most important person in my life.
She is an inspiration to everything I do.
I would not call her a friend, but she is an extraordinary person.
She has been in my life since I was born and she will always be in my life no matter what happens.
She is the one who has suffered to bring me into this world.
I have learnt to love her since the day I was born.
My mother was the first person to teach me to draw and walk, and she was with me when I took my first step ever!
She has taught me to believe in people and not to have grudges against one another.
She always encouraged me to go along when I was ready to give up.
She made sure that I was safe and happy throughout my childhood.
It is the unconditional love that my mother gives to me.
It is hard to describe the feeling that a mother has towards her children.
Mothers give an awful lot of support to their children, whether it involves very visible support or simple back encouragement.
Not only do mothers support their children, but they also often hold the whole family structure together.
When all is well, a mother puts her children before anything else, including their own comfort and happiness.
Describing a mother's love is virtually impossible.
It is a feeling that can only truly be understood by those that experienced it.
Famous saying states that "God could not be everywhere and so he invented mothers!
Garment Technologists can be employed by manufacturers or large, high-street retailers.
Working in the manufacturing and production industry, a technologist has a role in selecting and testing the ideal fabric or material for products.
A clothing/textile technologist works with a variety of fabrics, both man-made and natural fibers, as well as leather, fur, metals and plastics.
As a technologist, you’ll find fabrics or textiles that are fit for purpose and carry out quality control tests.
You’ll work on the development of products, improving production efficiency and quality, while incorporating with those involved in the production process.
Some technologists specialize in research and product development and may implement research to find new ways of using yarns, develop chemicals that may be added into fabrics to make them more waterproof, flame-resistant or shrink-resistant, and experiment with textiles to improve their look, feel, texture and durability.
You will need to have a high level of technical knowledge and strong practical skills, the ability to work as part of a team and to liaise with colleagues in other tasks.
Besides, you have to master organizational skills, to ensure time schedules are adhered to and deadlines are met.
It will be useful if you have got an interest in, and understanding of computer technology.

He will always be my hero.
To me, he is the best father in the world and my love and respect for him cannot be framed in words.
Environmental pollution has made negative effects on the life of every living things on Earth.
Nearly all of our achievements in the fields of industrial progress, science and technology have been realized at the cost of our health so far.
Even our flora and fauna have been found to be at risk of extinction.
All this really makes us wondering whether all our gains and industrial civilization really enable us to climb the peaks of prosperity or simply bring us down the blind alleys of adversity.
Many programs against environmental pollution are strenuously implemented against the indiscriminate violations committed daily in the name of development.
The environmental pollution is not only caused by the emission from nuclear tests or industries.
The smoke from the automobiles and other vehicles, the increasing use of synthetic detergents, nitrogen insecticides and fertilizers contaminate both air and water.
The water we use to drink the vegetables are all contaminated.
As a result, our world is suffering from a number of incurable diseases.
Nothing in this world is immune, no life is safe and the prospect of this world is bleak.
The factories are mostly built in residential areas and the smoke-emitting vehicles ply through the congestion areas.
Besides causing immense disturbances, it also leads to increasing number of case of pulmonary thrombosis and tuberculosis and various sorts of brain and heart complications.
Air-pollution may cause severe lung diseases, brain-disorder diseases, asthma.
Soil-pollution may negatively affect farm output ratio.
It can also contaminate the groundwater.
Noise-pollution have negative effects on hearing ability.
It can also cause deafness, tiredness, and mental losses.
The heat generated by industries and vehicles causes thermal pollution by raising the environmental temperature of the nearby areas.
The birth of mills and factories is the result of the growth of industry in this machine-predominated period.
As long as they will be there, they must emit smoke, pollute the air and hasten our end by slow-poisoning.
For teenagers, having a job is a way of earning money, just a way of having extra cash for movies or clothes.
It makes us feel independent.
Personally, it made me feel like an adult.
It taught me how to take responsibility and handle my finances.
I had to learn how to take public transportation, interact with my coworkers, work with different types of people, and also learn about punctuality.
In a way, it was almost like I had learned real life skills within 3 months.
I will never forget my first job experience.
It will always be a big part of my maturing and becoming a young adult.
Our supervisors helped us get familiar with Google Apps.
We played with it, did tutorials, did assignments until we knew what we were doing like the backs of our hands.
Finally, after a fortnight we were ready to start on a first project.
We were all assigned some clients and began building websites for them.
It was an interesting experience and I loved every step of it.
Not only did we build websites for clients, we did onsite training for different companies and helped them get acquaintance with Google Apps.
It required us to speak in front of public and be willing to answer questions.
It was nerve-wracking but my supervisor was there every step of the way, guiding and correcting my mistakes.
Week by week, time passed.
Before I knew it, it was the last day of my internship.
Both of my supervisors gave us some useful advice on furthering our future careers.
My internship has taught me many beneficial things.
They are to always have an open mind and be willing to work in any type of environment, to be willing to adapt to a new work place and be respectful and kind to not only my future supervisors but my coworkers as well.
What I have learned in the span of three months will always be a big part of me growing up.
I’m looking forward to taking what I’ve learned and applying it.
Whoever you are, you have the right to dream of your future job.
I also have one.
That is my desire to become a teacher.
Just thinking of my job, I feel so happy.
My friends often ask me that.
Why do you choose teaching?.
I smile.
I choose this job, because I love children so much.
I want to take care of them, teach them how to read, how to write, how to listen and show them the beautiful things of this life.
Teaching is similar to growing a tree up, you must have patience,carefulness, and passion.
And one of the important reasons that makes me choose this job is my parents.
They hope that I can complete your dream.
In Viet Nam, the salary of a teacher is quite low, but I still want to become a teacher, simply becauseI love this job and I believe in my love, as well as my passion for this job.
In the future, I will become a good teacher.
And now, I’m trying my best to complete the program in university to make my dream come true.
Smoking cigarettes is an expensive habit.
You can see, the average price per pack of cigarettes isabout 1 dollar, people who smoke 2 packs of cigarettes per daywill spend $2 one day on their habit.
At the end of a year those smokers will incur a debt.
Since smoking has an offensive odor that permeates into clothing,stuffed carpets and furniture, smokers often find that they must have those items cleaned more frequently than nonsmokers do.
Furthermore, a smoker would pay a lot of money for many diseasescaused by smoking.
Although it’s difficult to sum the cost of those additional expenses, I can say that the expenses do contribute to making smoking become a very expensive habit.
Watching television is my favourite activity I like doing in my free time.
I enjoy watching somesport programs on Saturday afternoons and movies and cartoons on Sunday mornings.
Ialways watch televisionduring the week after I have done all my homework.
At night, I like to watchcomedies and movies.
If I have a lot of homework, I will arrange my schedule so that I will have time to watch at least 1 of my favorite shows.
Watching television isn’t the only activity that I do in my free time.
One of my favorite activitiesis going shopping with my friends and making paper flowers.
However, I spend more time for watching television than many other activities.
Watching televisionmake me relax and provide me with a huge amount of knowledge about the world.
If you want to know.
what is the eternityin life ?
Only the answer is the sacrifice of mother.
Today, I rememberher in the last days of the year, remember the sacrifice that she has given me.
My mother always solves matters in life with sentiment , she is a sensitive woman.
Everything were taken care by her, even animal.
Sometimes, I feel jealousbecause I'm her daughter, I think I should be given more carethan all.
I'm becoming the more egoistic when I stay besidethat great woman.
She always tells me .
when you grow up, , don'tcompare the sentiment with anything in small life, especially motherhood ( it's everlasting ) and you will know how to express your feeling to someone in different ways, not possession bythe jealousy"All the things she do are just tohelp me to be a better human.
But I think if I can be a woman like her, It would be as great as I have all the world.
Today, Everyone goes back home, the city is not as noisy as the some days ago .
May be, they come back to their friendly family and prepare for Tet holiday.
My mother will be asking my sister .
why your younger sister is not staying at home, now ? 
I see all the otherstudents come back to their home, my daughter is still busy with part time job, isn't she ?
she will ask my sister until I come home.
I can say with certainty and I'm so happy aboutit.
since the very beginning of my schooling day as far as I remember, Ihave had an attraction for Mathematics.
Mathematics always gives me extra energy and satisfaction in my study.
I never feelbored with this subject.
As my father is an engineer, he always helps me to learn the subject well.
Also, he teaches me with a great technique of visual representation.
He createsa collection of intuitive Youtube videos for my favorite subject.
I like learning my favourite subject with myfull energy and want to become a mathematician or mathematics professor.
I like my favorite subject ( Mathematics) because of many reasons.
firstly, This subject doesn't need memorizingskill like what a parrot often does.
Only logical thinking is sufficient for this subject.
secondly, Mathematics always remains evergreen in demand in the field of education.
Lastly, Without it many life goals cannot be achieved.
It is the only subject in which anyone can score full marks andin almost case marks can be improved.
So these are the reasons why I have selected this subject to be my most favoriteone.
I practicemathematics by writing various formulas regularly.
This helps to give outimmediate ideasto solve any problems quickly.
I enjoy practicing critical sums of maths.
I always score above 95% in this subject.
It give me a lot of confidence and enjoyment.
Our environment is getting worse day by day, and we are suffering forour mistakes.
It's getting harder and harder for our families to stay healthy with all the bad thingsaround us every day.
We are affected by our environment, andmore and more people are found to be caught with diseases.
This could affect our families and our future one day.
We might not be able to see all of the bad things in our environment, but for sure, they are existing.
Although certain groups are most vulnerable, toxic substances in the environment affect every person andall of us have to take responsibility for them.
This saying supports my opinion about the cause because it is saying there aredangerous substances in our environment that we are responsible for.
We are getting sick and even dying because of the bad thingshuman are putting into the environment.
These health problems killed around more than 15.000victims in the year that followed.
Approximately 100.000 people still suffer from chronic diseases which are consequencesof gas exposure, today.
This is also stating that the things in our air are killing us.
All of this dangerous toxicsare the cause of getting diseases which are killing the people we love.
The winter of Hanoi starts from December and may last until the February, with the average temperature of 15-17°C.
Sometimes it drops to below 10°C and the high humidity will make the weather a little bit colder.
Remember to bring warm clothes if you don't want to get a cold when visiting a tropical country.
Winter often brings a sad feeling, because the sky is often dark and gloomy.
However, Hanoi seems to have its busiest days of the year and streets are more crowded than usual during working hours as people are in rush to complete all the remaining works and prepare for Tet holiday.
The cold weather enables people living in Hanoi or visitors to enjoy the tasty hot food like hotspot or grilled dishes.
Hanoi in early winter morning, the mist makes special beauty for the city.
Somewhere people carrying bunches of flowers cycle slowly in the quiet air.
Men prefer a hot cup of tea, sitting on the sidewalk evaporates, watching the flow of people back and forth.
Hanoi young women walk downstreet in beautiful clothes.
The children wear tightly when they are out, though only playing at doorstep.
The old, with glasses of cold beer, talk about life.
We can also catch the image of street venders struggling when it rains.
The winter is one of many beauties of Hanoi.
It's worth coming and enjoying the atmosphere in Hanoi.
In the past, I always thought that game online was a bad thing, because there were many people studying lazily and making their parents worry because of playing games too much.
But when I grow up, I realize that I mistake passion for addiction.
As the same, game online always has advantages and disadvantages.
The hotter a method of entertainment becomes, the more young people try it.
They don't need to know how the game is.
They will spend time on it, forget to work on the exercise, neglect their study at school.
At first, they want to keep up with the trend but then, it's hard for them to leave out that habit, which leads to serious consequences.
They attach importance on win, spend a lot of money on game to satisfy themselves.
They forget that playing game is just a means of entertainment after stressful classes so they easily get addicted.
However, there are some advantage of game online.
Firstly, we can react in the fastest way in all circumstances, we can become a game creator and have good team-work skills.
Secondly, we can explore the way of any game that is controlled, find the rules in each game and developed their idea in the future.
You can also have best friend and live more responsibly.
The most important thing is that people who play game have happy time, relax to concentrate on learning or working.
Game online is not bad, but their way play make it become bad.
Let try on playing a game one time and you won't feel disappointed.
When I was thirteen years old, Women's volleyball team of Viet Nam took part in the competition with other countries in the Southeast Asia region.
They played really wonderfully and I admired Mrs. Pham Thi Kim Hue who was a talent and beautiful female volleyball player.
Then, I decided to sign in the volleyball club in my school, I practiced some of basic volleyball skills in this club.
Of course, my parent didn't know because I didn't tell them.
At that time, I dreamed that I would become a as good volleyball player as Mrs. Pham Thi Kim Hue.
Every afternoon when classes ended, I played with my team (some of members in club) in two hours, we relaxed about 15 minutes, told some of the jokes, smiled together very happily.
After other members left, I stayed with hope.
The team leader could teach me more.
About a week later, my body hurt and appeared so much scratches, especially my arms.
Therefore, I hadn't been accustomed to strong activities for a long time before.
I consoled myself and continued practicing.
One day, while I were playing volleyball, I fell down in the slippery floor.
As a result, my right arm was broken, my parent was worried, their tear made me feel remorseful.
Since then, I sometime play volleyball but I realize.
Only love is never enough, your dream will be not perfect without the passion.
The past, I don't like the cooking.
One day, I just raised my head to surprise two eyes starting at me when I was holding a piece of almond cake.
He said.
can you make it?
I like it so much.
The fact, it was my friend but Ipromised that.
I will make a almond cake for him.
So, he was look handsome .
Today, I get up early and go to supermarket to buy some of raw material.
Needinga lot of ingredients.
1 cup sliced almonds, butter, purpose flour, 4 egg yolks, 2 large egg whites, whole milk, vanilla extract, fresh lemon juice, black berries, raspberries, salt, sugar.
After make a almond cake, I feel this very interesting.
It's too difficult to complete.
May be, I should make it in the future, the more one time.
I hope he like a cake I make painfully.
I will give for him, tomorrow.
I have never imagined to make a cake that have many processing stages.
But I promised, I will try my best.
Everybody in my family believe that.
I don't love my dad as the same the different children.
Because when I was 2 months old,I have always cried loudly whenever he come on, until I was 10 years old,I rarely talked to him.
I didn't know why was I do?
May be, I loved my father so much!
My dad is regularly busy, he has to go away my home, such as a working trip.
So, I live with my mom, my sister and my grandparents, I looking forward to the date he come back.
Despite the fact that I often cry, hide behind the door when I see him.
I keep in eye of the dad's action I feel happy so he is beside me.
If he take care of my sister the better than me, I will cry again.
My father is a quiet, taciturn and good man, he make people fell safe and comfortable.
He always buys gift for me, he hope to close to me and see his daughter scurrying, the walked up to him, gave him a kiss on the check and say.
I love you, dad.
Many time, I imagined this and promised myself that.
I will live by my true feelings, won't fear the break up again.
A long time past, my dad was retired but I went to school away from home so we rarely see each other.
When I have a free time, I phone to him and talk to funny stories that I see, talk to boyfriend that I like.
Suddenly, I realize one thing, without my father, is not the more perfect man appear in my life.
Having happiness, having sadness, we need accustomed to it.
I were come back my childhood, I will hide in the cabinet to look over the dad's action.
One thing is the most important in the present.
he have known my feelings.
Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February.
it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam.
Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar.
however, Vietnamese people often spend about nearly a month to celebrate this special event.
Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year.
however, its preparation starts long before that.
One week before the holiday, in the 23rd day of the last Lunar month, is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong).
It is believed that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth.
On the New Year's Eve, they return to earth to continue their duties as taking care of families.
On the New Year's Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they are believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).
After that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends and colleagues, wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health and success.
Many people ponder what they should do for a vacation and I realized a lot of people don't seem to share our views about traveling.
I believe it's very important to see the world and different cultures.
It lets us open our minds to new things and we get to experience life in exiting different ways.
Traveling gives us the opportunity to disconnect from our regular life.
You get to forget your problems for a few weeks, it can also help you figure things out that you would not have understood without the distance traveling can give you.
We all have crazy schedules, work and a family to take care of, going away alone or with some friends can give you distance and perhaps even make you realize how important these people are for you .
Like the saying says.
we never know what we have until we lose it.
Another great benefit is the relaxation you get to do.
It's nice to live life to its fullest and enjoy a stress free time with yourself.
Going on vacation lets us recharge our "batteries" by disconnecting us from our regular life.
When we come back we feel invigorated and we are happy to be back in our day to day routine.
It's a very good stress remover that has a lot more to give than most people are willing to accept.
Traveling increases our knowledge and widens our perspective.
To view new customs, different ways of living is fantastic for the mind.
It gives us a new perspective about life and especially our life, it can help us change some of our habits or even create new ones.
When I travel I usually make it a point to try new food, some cultures don't have fries in their diet and they are all skinny, others use spices to give taste and not oils or fats.
Discovering different values and ways to get by in life is really interesting.
You also need to visit exotic new places and discover what this wonderful world has to offer.
New experiences increase our resourcefulness by living situations you would never encounter at home, this is great experience for you when you come back to your routine.
I have noticed that people who traveled a lot in life were ready to embrace change and have a natural ability of overcoming problems that others would frown upon.
When traveling with friends or family it creates memories for a lifetime.
These memories will create a bond that nothing can erase no matter what happens with the friendship.
It can also give a new perspective on the relationship and cement the bond forever.
It also gives nice stories to tell people afterwards, you can create photo albums about your trips and when you feel nostalgic you can take an hour of your life and experience the trips again by looking at your pictures.
It's never been this cheap to travel.
With soaring oil prices the cheap travel era might be coming to an end.
However there are still many budget airlines fighting for your dollar right now.
With the internet and all the new technology, you can plan your trip exactly the way you want it.
You can choose your budget, the duration of the trip and what you want to do.
I suggest to read travel blogs and see what others are experiencing, you can save yourself a few hurdles by reading about their trip.
If you have some time off I suggest to take that trip and experience what life has to offer.
Don't wait or tell yourself there will be a better time to go.
Take the risk, the opportunity and buy your plane ticket right now and leave.
When you come back you won't be sorry that you left, on the contrary you will be thinking of your next trip the second you come back from the airport.
Feel free to let me know how traveling helped you out, what new experiences you lived and how they helped you in your life.
Michael Jackson is one of my favorite singers.
He is very famous, so most of all people in the world know him, at least his name.
I began to listen to his songs because I was recommended them by my friend, and I was really attracted by them.
I have two reasons why I like him.
To me, one of my best friends is Thành .
Thành is only over eighteen but he is well developed.
so he is thought to be twenty or more.
He has black hair, a broad forehead, a straight nose and bright eyes.
He is very good-looking.
He has a kind heart and is easy to get on with everybody.
We have been friends for a very long time.
The deeper our mutual understanding becomes the more we feel closely attached to each other.
Thành and I are keen on learning.
We are the best pupils in our class.
Thành is always at the top.
He is good at every subject, but he never shows pride in his abilities and always tries to learn harder.
Thành's family is not rich enough.
His parents are retired workers.
Realizing the hardships of his parents, although he is absorbed in his study, he often spends most of his spare time doing useful things to help his parents in their old age.
He gets up early in the morning to have enough time to deliver newspapers to subscribers before going to school.
After school in the afternoon, he repairs bicycles and motorbikes.
Therefore the money he gets from his manual job is sufficient for his school fees and for his parents' presents.
I like Thành very much because of his honesty and straight forwardness.
He is always ready to help his weak friends in their study.
as a result, lots of friends, thanks to his whole-hearten help, have become good ones.
My name is Tram and I am from Binh Dinh province/Vietnam.
I am currently studying Finance and Economics at Van Lang University.
I was raised in Binh Dinh and when I was 18 I moved to Ho Chi Minh city to take my university study.
Last year I went to Da Nang city to join the school's exchange program.
During my exchange I went backpacking with other backpackers from all over the city to other province/city across Vietnam.
It was a fun experience.
I think I have been fortunate enough to be able to live in different parts of our country and thus be able to broaden my horizon.
I have a strong interest in banking and financial services industry.
The reason is I'd like to leverage my detail-oriented mind and apply the skills and knowledge that I have attained throughout my degree courses.
I see myself as a people-oriented and over-achiever person.
I demonstrated this through working in various group projects with different types of people in which I had been able to perform well.
My strengths are my attitude that I like to take challenges that I CAN do it, self motivated person, self disciplined I am a good team player as well as has a good ability to lead the team.
I can adopt to any kind of environment.
I am a good listener and quick learner.
My weakness is I can not tolerate any leniency in work My short term goal is I want a such a platform where I can grow my career along with the organisation growth like yours and.
My Long term goal is I want to be one of the reason for the success of the organisation and I want to see your organisation as a bench mark to other organisations.
I would like to be part of your company to further develop myself in banking field and to use my capabilities to serve both your company and your clients.
Thats all about me sir.
Thank you for giving me such a wonderful opportunity.
Friendship is the most valuable relationship in the life of a person instead of having many important things in life.
No one of us has a complete and satisfied life if we lack faithful friendship.
Everyone needs a good and loyal friend to share bad or good life events, enjoy happy moments and share unbearable events of the life.
A good and balanced human interaction is very necessary for the survival of everyone.
Good friends share each other's emotions or sentiments which bring feeling of well being and mental satisfaction.
A friend is a person whom one can know deeply, like and trust forever.
Instead of being some similarity in the nature of two persons involved in the friendship, they have some different traits but they need each other without changing their uniqueness.
Generally, friends motivate each other without criticizing but sometimes good friends criticize to bring some positive changes in each other.
Environment is an essential part of our life.
A clean environment is necessary for a peaceful and healthy life.
An environment is the natural surroundings which helps human beings, animals and other living things to grow and develop naturally.
But nowadays, our environment is disturbing in many different ways.
Any type of disturbance in the nature's balance affects the environment totally.
It does not only ruin human lives but also affects on all living beings.
We can save our environment with the little step taken by everyone on the earth.
We should reduce the amount of waste, throwing wastes properly to its place only.
and many other simple ways.
It is very important to save environment for human existence.
When we protect the environment, we are protecting ourselves and our future as well.
Friendship is one of the most precious presents of life.
Friendship makes life, sweet and pleasant experience.
Friendship is indeed, an asset in life.
Friendship is good and necessary.
Man cannot live all alone because he is a social being.
He needs someone to share his joys and sorrows.
There goes a saying"Friendship increases happiness and diminishes misery by doubling our joy and dividing our grief".
Friendship can make or break us.
It all depends on how we choose our friends.
We spent much of our time with them.
Their mental outlook, behaviour, attitudes affect us too.
Today, many youngsters have become social nuisance mainly due to bad friends.
Therefore, we have to choose our friends very carefully.
We have to remember the maxim "All that glitters is not gold".
We have to distinguish between fair-weather friends and true friends.
True friends remain with us through thick and thin while fair-weather friends are found only during sunny days.
True friendship is a feeling of love, sharing and caring.
It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are, without any flattery.
It gives a feeling that you are 'wanted' and that you are 'someone' and not a faceless being in the crowd.
True friendship knows no boundaries of caste, creed, race and sex.
Good friends are great pillars of life.
A person who has true friends in life is lucky enough.
It does not matter how often you meet your friends, but how much you care and feel for another in good times as well as in bad times.
Everybody has their own type of hobby.
Mine tends to be a little delicate, and it requires me to put in such tender care and love.
That is, gardening.
My boyfriend and I live together in a small house, even though the size of the house itself is not ideal compare to other houses nowadays, but it's still fully equipped.
And, the only one special thing that makes our house stand out, is our backyard garden.
My boyfriend shares the same interest for gardening as me.
We always spend times together taking care of the garden every day.
Covering the entire yard is a grass carpet of deep green.
The garden of us gathers a diversity of colors from many kinds of flower such as Roses, Lilies, Sunflowers.
Likewise, our garden is also covered by one such soothing aroma from the bushes of Orange Jasmine (hoa nguyệt quế).
Watering, fertilizing, as well as pruning (tỉa lá), are some small works that we do to take care of our lovely garden.
They might sound simple, but in order to complete such those small acts, you have to give in your real effort and love.
If you could do so, I truly believe you yourself would be able to own a spectacular garden that blooms out not only lively colors, but also a unique fragrance, just like our garden.
An ideal family with 2 children.
Previously, Our Ancestor often thought that the more children we had, the more happines we found.
However, in reality, a large family will lead to a lot of problems for the family in particular and for the development of society in general.
Many social studies have shown an ideal family is a family with two children.
This is a perfect model for couples with a modern lifestyle because it can overcome various problems that can occur in a family.
Specifically here is how people take care of their children.
In 1 minute, your children may hurt themselves by playing with sharp objects such as knife.
Many kids have met tragic accident when they participate in playful activities by water without adult supervision.
So parents will take care for children easier and more attentive when they only have two children.
Nurturing is another challenge for parents.
However, according to a government report by a government agency, the children raised in families with two children often have better behavior than the kids who have too many brothers and sisters.
The children born and raised in a family with few children will get more attention and lessons from from their parents.
Instead of wresting love from their parents, these children are also gainmore opportunities to be heard and to share.
Another problem will be solved when a family decides to have few children is finance.
We can not deny the necessity of money in guarantee a fulfilled life and a brighter future for our children.
Money will be used to pay for education and health care fee when children are sick.
On the contrary, in a overcrowded home, parents will be faced more financial burden, especially when the kids are born closely with their siblings.
The problem can becomes worse if the family fell into difficult circumstances and do not have enough ability to send their children to school, the children will easily involve into crime matters and became sorrow not only for their parents but also for the society.
My hobby is reading knowledgeable and interesting books in my square time.
Reading is such a good habit which healthy for your brain and keeps your brain functioning actively.
Reading is a wonderful way to keeps you relax and happy.
For me, there is nothing makes me happier than to have a stack of books on my nightstand to attack on a night when there is no alarm clock waiting the next morning.
It's the great source of enjoyment, inspiration , instruction, and knowledge.
Reading book can make us disciplined, punctual, loyal and most importantly a very successful person in this life.
While reading books, noone can feel disturb or alone.
I think this hobby is more precious than other precious stones in the world.
It can provide us noble thoughts, ideas to work in many fields and high level of knowledge.
Interesting and knowledgeable book is like best friend of the someone who likes to read.
Book is one part of my beautiful life and reading book has definitelybeen my favourite hobby.
I will be able to never forget the interesting moment when my father gave me the first book which is full of colourful pictures.
I was very delighted though I difficultly understood what were there in that book.
I read wherever, whenever, and whatever kinds of books, from short story, comic, to novel and many more.
My father always encourages me to read book and He buys me many useful and interesting books.
Books are like my friends who can teach me many things over the world.
They let me know of a lot of beautiful places and the history of our country and many others.
My tears come from those books and so do my happy laughters.
Most free time of mine is spent on discovering books, books are very useful and so great.
Reading books is the most interesting indoor activities that you should try.
It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system.
Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase.
There are two key factors behind this trend.
For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use.
The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet.
As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production.
In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a "stock" economy to a "flow" economy.
This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users.
However, a new imperative-sustainable development – offers an opportunity for adapting the EU，s common transport policy.
This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy.
The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years‟ time, that is by 2040.
The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing.
This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of transport.
In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport.
However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton.
The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics, technology).
However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regional cohesion.
It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion‟s share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes.
It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance.
The tallest building in Europe is nearly complete.
Rising above a new waterfront complex in St.Petersburg, Russia, the Lakhta Center's tower stands at 462 meters (1,516 feet) tall, making it the city's first supertall building (one measuring 300 meters or above).
The structure is now the northernmost skyscraper in the world, according to its developers.
The 87-story tower twists a full 90 degrees from its foundation to its top, like a winding needle.
This makes it one of the world's tallest examples of a twisted skyscraper design.
Its soaring height is offset by a lower mixed-use building with a 260-meter-long (853-foot-long) facade.Residential and commercial space will be installed up to a height of 360 meters (1,181 feet), above which an observation deck and restaurant will offer breathtaking views over the Gulf of Finland.
The Lakhta Center takes the title of Europe's tallest building from Moscow's Federation Tower, completed in 2017, which stands at 374 meters (1,227 feet).
Moscow is also home to five of the next six entries in the list, interrupted only by London's Shard, which was briefly the continent's tallest in 2012, at 310 meters (1,016 feet) tall.
The firm is set to move in by the end of 2019.
According to Philip Nikandrov, one of the architects involved with the project, the exterior of the building will be completed by the end of this summer, although the interior fitting will continue into 2019.
Drone images show the main tower's impressive silhouette, which was designed to symbolize a flame -- a distinctive feature of Gazprom's logo.
Every year on May 5th of the lunar calendar, some countries China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam have Mid-year Festival.
In China, on this day, they celebrate a festival called Dragon Bloat Festival.
In Vietnam, the festival celebrated on May 5th is called Tet Doan Ngo, Worm-killing Festivalof Vietnamese.
Some researchers think that the celebration has its origin in China.
There is a legend Qu Yuan – Chinese poet who lived during the Warring States period of ancient China.
In Vietnam, we call him Khuat Nguyen.
He was a faithful person but living in the empire in decline.
He hindered the king from making some bad decisions.
Other officials devised false stories about him.
The king did not follow his advice and hated him.
He was so sad and drowned himself in the Mich La, China on May 5th of the lunar calendar.
Chinese people regretted the person having a clear heart.
Every year, on this day, people made cakes with five-color strings and dropped them to the river to offer Khuat Nguyen.
They tied five-color strings on the cakes in order to make fishes afraid and do not dare to eat the cakes.
They also poured rice into bamboo tubes and dropped them into the river.
The custom gradually spread through some nearby countries.
Vietnamese people call this day Worm-killing Festival because most farmers start killing worms on their rice fields and orchards.
Vietnamese ancestors had told us a story about Doi Truan who taught farmers how to kill a lot of worms in fruits and rice.
He offered Banh gio (a kind of Pyramid sticky rice cake), fruits to Gods in front of a house.
He told that if all farmers did the same things on the same day every year, all worms will be weaker and killed easily.
The man had disappeared after helping killing worms.
Nowadays, grandparents tell their children about the stories, teach them to be grateful to ancestors and the country's tradition.
FLC chairman to increase stakes.
Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of FLC, has registered to increase his ownership in the property company by 2.1 percentage points.
He said in a recent statement he would buy 15 million shares between June 26 and July 25 to increase his stake to 23.3 percent.
With FLC trading at VND4,200 (18 cents) at the time of publishing, the acquisition will cost him around VND63 billion ($2.7 million).
Quyet had said last year he would spend VND1.5-2 trillion ($65-86 million) in 2020 to acquire more FLC shares. The share price has fallen by 11 percent this year.
He has been selling his stake in FLC Faros, a construction arm of FLC, from 51.3 percent to 4.17 percent for over VND900 billion ($39 million), and resigned as chairman of the company.
An FLC Faros spokesperson said the divestment could mean Quyet wants to focus more on the parent company and the carrier it owns, Bamboo Airways.
FLC, a developer of resorts and golf courses, expects a loss of VND1.96 trillion ($84 million) this year due to the impacts of the coronavirus.

Insurance company to cover VND 3.5-billion treatment cost of British pilot.
An insurance company will bear the cost of VND 3.5 billion to treat the 91st patient, a British pilot, who was the country's most critical case of Covid-19, at the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
The company has sent a payment confirmation to the hospital, paying the entire cost of treatment of the 43-year-old man from March 18 to May 22, Nguoi Lao Dong Online reported.
A representative of the hospital said the treatment cost escalated when the patient needed the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to allow his lungs and heart to improve and function properly.
The patient also suffered blood clotting disorders and the anticoagulants sold in the local market failed to treat him, the representative said, adding that, as such, the Ministry of Health allowed other anticoagulants from foreign markets to be imported.
The patient has been treated at Cho Ray Hospital since May 22 and the treatment cost remains unknown.
Father, son jailed for raping disabled woman.
A Binh Thuan Province court has sentenced a father and son to three and nine years each for raping, impregnating an intellectually disabled woman.
Nguyen Thanh Tam, 43, was jailed for three years while his 20-year-old son Nguyen Huu Thanh got nine years after the latter was identified as the father of the baby, the court ruled Monday.
Both were forced to pay VND70 million ($3,016) in compensation for mental trauma and supporting the mother in raising the child.
According to the indictment, Thanh and the victim were cousins.
In late 2018, he visited her home in Ham Thuan Nam District in the south-central Binh Thuan Province, noting she lived alone.
Thanh later forced her into a room where he raped her on two different occasions in the following days.
Thanh's father also visited the victim's home where he continued to rape her.
Tam threatened to kill her if she revealed the secret.
In mid-2019, the victim's mother noticed something amiss in her daughter and took her to a hospital where doctors found she was around six months pregnant.
After the victim told her mother what had happened, she called on local police to launch a criminal investigation.
In November 2019, the victim gave birth to a boy, DNA results confirming Thanh to be the father.
The Central Institute of Mental Forensics in the southern Dong Nai Province concluded the victim suffered intellectual disability with limited cognition and behavior control.

Vietnam to allow int'l soccer betting payments via e-wallets.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing to allow soccer and horse racing bettors to make payments via e-wallets, bank accounts or prepaid mobile phone accounts, as part of a new legal document, for which the ministry is seeking feedback, to replace a decree over betting on horse and dog racing and international soccer events.
The prevailing regulations allow people to only place bets via mobile phones and pay for betting tickets via bank accounts.
However, with the rapid growth in technology and cashless payment methods, it is essential to expand payment methods to create favorable conditions for bettors, the ministry explained.
Since each payment method has its own upside, bettors can opt to link their betting accounts with their bank accounts, e-wallets, or prepaid mobile phone subscriptions.
These payment methods can also help in terms of rewarding bettors, wherein they can get cash rewards transferred to their linked accounts by betting companies or agents and can withdraw the money in line with the prevailing regulations on e-payment.
The ministry suggested these payment accounts must be opened at cashless payment service providers or e-wallet operators in accordance with Vietnam's regulations on non-cash payment.
Moreover, as per existing regulations, the betting sum of money must be at least VND10,000 each time, and the daily maximum amount set for each player placing a bet at a certain betting firm is VND1 million.
Any change to the quota must be sent to the Government for consideration and approval.
Accordingly, the finance ministry suggested eliminating these betting limits.
Instead, under the new decree, the ministry should coordinate with the relevant ministries and agencies to present plans to the prime minister on betting limits for different periods.
Further, the Government leader should take additional responsibility for revising the betting limits for each period in the new decree, said the ministry.

Binh Chanh begins demolishing Tram Chim resort.
After a long period of suspension due to the Tet holiday and the coronavirus pandemic, Binh Chanh District in HCMC on June 23 restarted tearing down numerous facilities at Gia Trang Quan, also known as the Tram Chim Resort, which was illegally developed in Tan Quy Tay Commune.
A representative from the government of the commune told Thanh Nien Online that the large-scale commercial complex was developed on land which is for agricultural purposes only.
The demolition is aimed at forcing Tran Thi Minh Trang, the owner of the resort, to restore the status of the land covering an area of over 7,260 square meters.
The authorities had earlier demanded that Trang demolish the illegal portions of the resort but she remained defiant, the representative added.
At 8.00 a.m. today, a working team of 200 people and vehicles were dispatched to the resort for the demolition, which is expected to be completed within one week.
Tram Chim Resort, which was built in 2015, comprises 65 guest rooms, 16 karaoke rooms, 13 sauna rooms, and many other facilities.
Following a decision to demolish Tram Chim Resort, the Binh Chanh government on November 19, 2019, asked 17 individuals concerned to practice self-criticism as they failed to closely cooperate and address the illegal construction, thus prolonging the entire process.
When the Binh Chanh government began demolishing the construction work at the resort, Tran Thi Minh Trang filed a lawsuit against the district government and demanded that it revoke the Binh Chanh chairman’s decision demanding the illegal facilities at the resort be destroyed.
Trang said the demolition has caused heavy losses for her.
Calling for cryptocurrency investment is illegal.
A former top police official asked local residents to stay clear of persons calling for investments in cryptocurrencies to avoid being cheated, as drives to mobilize capital for the crypto business are unlawful in Vietnam.
Besides breaking Vietnamese laws, investors in cryptocurrencies could also face risks.
Cryptocurrencies or virtual money and payments made using such money are not legally recognized in the country, according to Vu Hoang Kien, former deputy head of the Criminal Police Department, under the Ministry of Public Security.
The police have cracked down on many crypto rings so far.
Many investors have been lured through the simple investment procedures and interest rate as high as 90% per month, and have been consequently defrauded for up to hundreds of billions of dong.
Some swindlers have even offered an astounding interest rate of 120% per month to attract investors.
Kien advised locals not to be tempted by the high-interest rates in the crypto business, as this could mean going against Vietnamese laws and lead to substantial debt for themselves, their families and friends.
According to Nguyen Nam Hao from the Police Department for Corruption, Smuggling, and Economic Crimes, despite the many warnings issued on the matter, many locals are still investing in cryptocurrencies.
To date, only the Government’s Decree 96 stipulates administrative fines at VND150 million-VND200 million for individuals that issue, supply, and use unlawful payment methods, including Bitcoins and other virtual currencies.

Heat wave forecast to hit central, northern regions.
Localities in the northern and central regions are expected to brace for a heatwave early this week, from June 22-24, with high temperatures likely rising up to 42 degrees Celsius in some areas.
These regions suffer the high temperatures due to the impact of a high heat pressure in the west which expands its scale to the southeast, coupled with Foehn wind, according to the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Weather Forecasting.
The hot wave will likely send the temperatures soaring above 35 degrees Celsius from 10 to 18 hours per day, in addition to the low humidity of 30%-50%.
Specifically, in the northwest region, the extreme weather could kick off high temperatures in the provinces of Son La and Hoa Binh at between 35 and 38 degrees Celsius, even above 39 degrees in some areas today, June 22.
As for the northeastern region and the capital city of Hanoi, local people could experience the hottest days with temperatures ranging between 36 and 39 degrees Celsius.
Meanwhile, thundery showers could spread across some areas in the Central Highlands and southern regions, with monsoon blowing at level three. Lightning, hail, and sudden squalls may happen during thundershowers.
AFF Cup format to remain unchanged despite Vietnam suggestion.
The ASEAN Football Federation has decided not to change the home-and-away format of the 2020 AFF Cup.
At an online AFF conference on June 11 the Vietnam Football Federation suggested the event should be played in just one or two countries if the Covid-19 pandemic is not controlled across the region by the end of this year.
In Vietnam, the outbreak has been controlled and there has been no community transmission for over two months, making it a favorite to be host or joint host if its proposal had been accepted.
Vietnam is also the defending champion.
But the AFF, after considering the suggestion, decided not to change the format, and teams will play each other at home and away just like the 2018 edition.
It said the 2022 World Cup qualifiers will also take place at the end of this year with their format unchanged, which is playing home and away matches, so it would be unreasonable for AFF to change the format of their event.

There is no evidence that Vietnamese customs officials have received bribes from Japanese company Tenma as alleged by Japanese news reports.
Deputy Director-General of Vietnam Customs Nguyen Duong Thai said Thursday that preliminary investigations have found no evidence that tax money was lost to alleged bribery by plastic appliances maker Tenma Vietnam.
Authorities are still investigating the allegation that the company, based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, bribed Vietnamese officials JPY25 million ($215000) to reduce its tax liability.
Further information was needed from Japanese authorities, Thai said.

To avoid the tax, the company paid a senior customs official VND2 billion ($86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August 2019 Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, of JPY89 million ($826,400).
The company had then paid VND3 billion ($129,000) in cash to tax officials to get the amount reduced to $24,300.
Bac Ninh customs and tax officials have denied the allegations.
Tenma Vietnam continues to operate normally at the Que Vo Industrial Park in Bac Ninh.

British pilot no longer needs lung transplant.
A lung transplant considered for Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot, is no longer necessary following a recovery.
Luong Ngoc Khue, head of the Ministry of Health's department of diagnosis and treatment, said Wednesday the 43-year-old man in HCMC, who beat Covid-19 after two months but remains under treatment due to lung infection, is now recovering well and can breathe on his own.
He's fully conscious and capable of coherent verbal communication, Khue said.
Sức mạnh cơ bắp chân tay và chức năng hô hấp của anh đã hồi phục.
In May, the health ministry considered a lung transplant for the British pilot as his condition at the time was much more severe.
Computed tomography scan results showed that fibrosis had solidified most of his lungs, and he constantly relied on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to stay alive.
But as his condition progressed, his lungs slowly got better. He was finally taken off ventilators last week, and has breathed on his own since.
He has now been in treatment for three months, the longest period for any Covid-19 patient in Vietnam.
The country has recorded 335 Covid-19 cases so far, with only ten active infections left and no deaths. It has gone over two months without community transmission.

Chinese contractor withdraws demand for US$50m for Hanoi railway project.
Following meetings between Chinese contractor China Railway 6 Bureau Group and the Vietnamese transport authority, the Chinese contractor has withdrawn its request of US$50 million for the operation of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi.
The Vietnamese transport authority fully understands the obstacles encountered by the Chinese contractor but the payment of this sum of money is unjustifiable.
The Vietnamese side only makes payments based on the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract and in line with Vietnam’s laws, said Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Ngoc Dong.
In addition, the transport ministry has requested the relevant agencies to expedite the project so it can be put into service this year, as requested by the prime minister.
Regarding the return of Chinese personnel to Vietnam after travel restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased, Deputy Minister Dong confirmed that 28 Chinese experts have arrived in Vietnam.
The remaining 100 Chinese personnel are following certain procedures to return to the country.

Ministry considers postponing school opening day to August 15.
The Ministry of Education and Training is considering deferring the first day of the 2020-2021 school year until August 15 instead of August 1 and extending the summer vacation for students, according to the VnExpress news site.
According to the initial plan, the first day of school for kindergartens, high schools and vocational schools was slated for August 1, 2020.
The opening ceremony for the new school year would be held on September 5, 2020.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 2019-2020 academic year will end on July 15, one and a half months later than scheduled.
Therefore, if the 2020-2021 academic year begins on August 1 as initially planned, the summer vacation will only be for two weeks.
Although the 2019-2020 school year is scheduled to end on July 15, some provinces and cities such as Nghe An have accelerated the study program to end the school year before July, thus ensuring students enjoy a longer vacation.
In Hanoi, senior high schools such as Nguyen Du and Trung Vuong are holding the final exams for students, while Nguyen Tat Thanh High School and HUS High School for Gifted Students have already ended the 2019-2020 school year.

Pilot error reason for Vietjet plane skidding off runway.
The aviation incident involving a Vietjet passenger aircraft skidding off a runway in HCMC last weekend as serious, Transport Minister Nguyen Van The noted that it was mainly the fault of the pilot.
Amid the heavy downpour and strong winds on Sunday afternoon, the pilot should have accurately evaluated the weather conditions before landing to ensure safety.
He received instructions from air traffic controllers while landing, but he has the right to decide whether to land or not.
He could have asked for permission to divert the plane and land at another airport, the minister told the local media on the sidelines of the ninth session of the 14th National Assembly on June 15.
The official noted that an investigation team from the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) would decode the plane’s black box to determine why the pilot decided to touch down amid the poor weather conditions.
Commenting on a CAAV press release stating that the weather was the leading cause of the incident, Minister The said the CAAV investigators would work to determine the exact cause of the accident and announce their final decision.
The two foreign pilots operating the plane that skidded off the runway have been suspended from service and their licenses have been seized pending the investigation.

Vietjet pilots’ licenses seized after the accident.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has suspended two foreign pilots from work and seized their licenses after a Vietjet aircraft skidded off the runway while landing in HCMC yesterday afternoon.
It also suspended six flight attendants and formed a team to investigate the incident.
However, the aircraft was not pulled to the airport’s apron until 8:30 p.m. on the day as technical staff had to elevate the plane to replace its blown-out tyre and conduct other checks.
The incident affected hundreds of flights to and from the airport.
According to a captain who is a flight instructor, similar landing incidents have occurred during bad weather conditions such as heavy rain and strong winds.
The captain explained that the pilot could have been unable to control the plane in the right direction due to the heavy downpour and tailwind, leading to it sliding off the runway.
Moreover, if the pilot suddenly hits the brakes, it could cause possible damage to the nose gear and the plane can skid off the runway as a result.
Early this morning, the plane was towed away from the scene of the incident.

A solar eclipse occurs when the disk of the moon appears to cross in front of the disk of the sun.
An annular eclipse occurs when the sun appears as a bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the moon.
The last solar eclipse seen in Vietnam was an annular eclipse on December 26 last year.
Scientists have sounded the warning: sky watchers should only see the eclipse indirectly or with proper glasses to prevent retinal burns.
HCMC hires private firm to build 372 ASEAN standard restrooms.
A private company has struck deals to build and maintain 372 restrooms of ASEAN Public Toilet Standards at many public spots in HCMC.
In return for its investment, estimated at around VND500 million ($21,500) for each facility, the company will be allowed to set up and run a convenience store in the vicinity.
Agreements to this effect have been reached between district authorities and the city-based Tien Phong Tech JSC.
Of the total, 283 restrooms will be established at spots chosen by districts, and 89 at bus stations.
So far, several restrooms of this type have been set up on a pilot basis around the city, including one at the corner of Tu Xuong and Cach Mang Thang Tam streets in District 3.
The restroom is a stainless steel affair with doors that open by pressing a button and close automatically after the user has entered the cabin.
Inside it is equipped with soap, hand sanitizer, and hand dryer, all designed to operate automatically.
One cabin covers a floor area of 70 square meters.
The investor is allowed to open a booth to sell convenience goods next to the restroom to recover the investment capital.
The restrooms are designed and produced exclusively by Tien Phong Tech.
The surrounding areas of the toilet should be kept clean, safe and provide easy access for visitors, and the exterior and interior design can either use traditional or modern architecture.
Each facility should have at least one toilet for the disabled with bigger doors for wheel chair access and railings for support.
HCMC has assigned district-level authorities to approve private investments in public toilets and cut the time taken for processing it.
Last month, the municipal environment department issued a guidance document saying that the authorities will provide land plots for the investors to set up public restrooms, and in return, the investors will be allowed to run certain services alongside to recover their investment.

Vietnam begins importing live pigs from Thailand.
Vietnam has given the green light for the import of pigs from Thailand for the purposes of both farming and slaughter from June 12 to bring down domestic pork prices that have skyrocketed due to the scarcity caused by the African swine fever epidemic.
Thailand was chosen as the supplier as its wholesale prices of hogs currently range between VND55,000 and VND60,000 per kilo, lower than Vietnam’s current prices averaging VND95,000 per kilogram.
Pham Tran Sum, director of Viet Duc International Nutrition Company, informed Nguoi Lao Dong Online that the firm is finalizing dossiers for the import of pigs for slaughter in Vietnam and is expected to receive the first batch of 2,000 pigs early next week.
Following the information, local pig prices dropped slightly to VND86,000 to VND87,000 per kilo.
When Thai pork is launched in the market, domestic prices may fall to below VND85,000 a kilo, Sum noted.
On June 11, Agriculture and Rural Development Deputy Minister Phung Duc Tien tasked the Animal Health Department with issuing detailed guidelines on quarantine measures for the imported pigs in line with existing regulations to prevent diseases and ensure the safety of domestic herds.
The department director is also responsible for ensuring coordination with inter-sector agencies at ports of entry and local authorities to strictly manage the live imports.

VinFast opens office in Australia.
Vietnamese carmaker VinFast has entered the Australian market by opening a research and development center in Melbourne on June 11 as part of its strategic plan to go global.
VinFast Australia is located next to Melbourne’s Financial and Economic Center and Monash University, in addition to many large-scale research facilities.
Such a prime location is convenient for research development and business activities.
The Australia-based office will research and develop new automobile models including gasoline-driven and electric cars, as well as lay the foundation for the carmaker’s global expansion, realizing its goal to become a global car brand by connecting with leading suppliers.
The new office employs some one hundred official employees, who are high-profile experts and engineers from the world's leading automobile corporations such as GM, Toyota, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover.
Being considered a “headquarters” of many major car manufacturers including Toyota, Ford, Mitsubishi and GM, Melbourne has several existing facilities, supply chains and manpower with a wealth of experience in the automobile industry.
VinFast, a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup, tested its first electric car in the capital city of Hanoi late last month to prepare for the new model’s debut by the end of the year.
The carmaker is set to launch the new electric model at the Los Angeles Auto Show in the United States in November.
Virtual jokes, real consequences.
Last month, news about actor Tran Thanh taking drugs with some of his celebrity friends were simmering among Vietnamese netizens.
The information was posted on Facebook with screenshots of a conversation between a group of friends.
Several hours later, the "joke" post was removed after thousands of people had viewed it.
The actor, an accidental victim of online rumors, decided to meet the women responsible for the post, in the presence of his lawyer.
"I do not know you.
You made up a story and spread it on the Internet, that is intentionally wrong,"  Trấn Thành told the supposed culprits last week.
Tran Thanh is among dozens of Vietnamese celebrities suddenly faced with the hurdles of rumors and misinformation spread via social media.
Death hoaxes are some of the most popular tricks.
Two months ago, a Facebooker posted photos of model Truong My Nhan depicting a deadly traffic accident, causing netizens to think her dead.
In 2018, singer Nhat Kim Anh was said to be a drug addict and "sleep with every man in showbiz.".
Kim Anh had to ask local police to investigate the woman responsible for the rumor.
Celebrities are the first victims of news about themselves spread on the Internet, which can cause scandals and directly affect their commercial activities.
According to actor Tran Thanh, 10 companies he has collaborated with asked for an explanation last week after rumors about him using drugs made the virtual airwaves.
Two other brands halted negotiations over new advertising contracts.
How can they sign a contract if my reputation is ruined? It affects my life and family, Tran Thanh said.
Many artists have shared their frustration and worries, including actor Van Anh and his wife who were said to be divorced after faking their marriage.
In April, local government decided to slap fines on those who post false, slanderous or lurid content online.
A new decree regulates fines of between VND10-20 million ($434 - 868) for taking advantage of social networks to provide fake information, slander or insult agencies and organizations, and lower the honor or dignity of individuals.
Trấn Thành has asked his lawyer to consider suing those who made up the rumors and report the case to local police.
In 2015, Hanoi police apprehended Tran Thi Huong Giang, 37, residing in Ba Dinh District, after she created several Facebook accounts to post and share fake news on local celebrities, calling it "truth conveying.".
The truth is, about half of Hanoi and Saigon residents encounter fake news at least once a week, according to a survey by Indochina Research last year.
Many are concerned about the impact of misinformation on their daily lives.
Rumors about celebrities, spread with the speed of light on the Internet.
The women accusing actor Tran Thanh of sniffing cocaine on Facebook said they were making a joke and apologized.
Meanwhile, the person spreading rumors about singer Nhat Kim Anh tried to deny her actions, saying her account was hacked.
Tran Thanh is the first Vietnamese celeb to take legal action against those sharing rumors about his personal life, with support from colleagues, many of whom had previously chosen to keep silent.
Proposal to allow five days off for National Day holiday rejected.
Minister of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs Dao Ngoc Dung has given multiple reasons for rejecting a proposal to increase the number of days off to five for Vietnam's National Day holiday on September 2.
Minister Dung told the local media on the sidelines of the ongoing sitting of the 14th National Assembly on June 10 that even though the proposal is aimed at boosting the tourism sector, it is necessary to carefully consider other aspects and assess its impact.
This year, National Day is in the middle of the week, leading to a wide gap between the holiday and the weekend, he noted, adding that receiving compensation for the days off is unreasonable.
Over the past few months, as Vietnam adopted various Covid-19 prevention and control measures and issued the social distancing order, employees and students have had several weeks off.
It is now high time for the country to both prevent and fight the coronavirus and focus on getting the manufacturing sector back on track and recovering the labor market to foster economic growth.
The Government can only allow the two million public employees to take days off for the holiday, a trivial number compared with the 55 million active laborers.
If the prime minister passes the proposal, the tourism sector will not see significant benefits, said Minister Dung.
Apart from this, between September 3 and 5, students normally start their new academic year.
For these reasons, the ministry and I have objected to the proposal to allow five days off for the upcoming national day holiday.
I had discussed the proposal with the prime minister and he agreed with my opinion, said Minister Dung.
Tourism authorities had previously proposed that the Government extend the National Day holiday on September 2 by four days to stimulate the tourism sector after Covid-19.

Butterflies taste with their feet.
A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.
They have taste sensors on their feet, and by standing on a leaf, they can taste it to see if their caterpillars can eat it.
Most adult butterflies can't bite or chew.
They eat mainly liquids like nectar, sap, juices from fruits, etc.
The blue whale's whistle is the loudest noise!
Blue whales mostly emit very loud, highly structured, repetitive low-frequency rumbling sounds that can travel for many miles underwater.
These songs may be used for communicating with other blue whales, especially in order to attract and find mates.
The call of the blue whale reaches levels up to 188 decibels.
This extraordinarily loud whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles underwater.
Theoretical calculations by Roger Payne and Douglas Webb (from the 1970′s) predicted that the loudest whale sounds might be transmitted across an entire ocean.
The blue whale is much louder than a jet, which reaches only 140 decibels! Human shouting is 70 decibels. sounds over 120 decibels are painful to human ears.
Mosquitoes are attracted to the color blue twice as much as to any other colors.
There are two kinds of Pandas.
Did you know there are two kinds of panda? There is a long-tailed Himalayan carnivore that looks like a raccoon and there is a giant panda bear that lives in Western China.
Slug have four noses.
Although they don't have the same type ofrespiratory system that the humanbeing has so their nose performs a different function to ours.
But they do have appendages that can sense heat and other stimuli, in other words they have 4 sensory organs where there nose looks like it should be.
But no actual nose.
Russian pilot falls into cliff when paragliding in Yen Bai.
A Russian pilot has met with an accident and fallen into the cliff from the height of 20 meters when joining the 2020 paragliding festival held in Mu Cang Chai District in the northwestern province of Yen Bai.
A grassroots officer of Mu Cang Chai's Cao Pha Commune confirmed on June 2 that the accident happened on May 30, the local media reported.
After a few seconds of taking off, the male pilot's paraglider teetered and fell into the cliff.
The leader of Cao Pha Commune said that the pilot flew the paraglider in a wrong way, leading to the unexpected fall.
The victim sustained minor back injury in the accident and is receiving treatment at Viet Duc Hospital in Hanoi City.
The paragliding festival taking place on Saturdays and Sundays from May 30 to July 15 is aimed at introducing tourism images of Yen Bai.
Local gasoline price could rise sharply tomorrow.
Local fuel wholesalers forecast that the gasoline price in the local market will rise some VND1,000 per liter tomorrow, June 12, following an upsurge in global petrol prices over the last 15 days.
Data from the Ministry of Industry and Trade revealed that the prices of RON92 and RON95 gasoline traded in Singapore's market as of June 8 were US$39.25 and US$42.16 per barrel, respectively, both up 19% against the previous 15-day period.
Oil prices also soared to US$42 per barrel.
A fuel merchant in HCMC said that local fuel traders have been suffering losses since their commission was sharply reduced, while the global fuel prices have been seeing an upward trend these days.
Accordingly, local fuel prices may be revised upward in line with the global market price.
Based on the global increment level, oil and gasoline prices in the local market are expected to edge up by VND800-VND1,000 per liter if the national fuel stabilization fund is untapped, the merchant said.
A representative of a fuel firm in Hanoi said that tomorrow will possibly mark the third consecutive time that local fuel prices are set to rise sharply since April 28.
He predicted that local oil and petrol prices will edge up some VND500-VND600 per liter.
Bulgarian jailed for stealing bank account data.
Stamov Ruslan Todorvo, 37, entered Vietnam last October and stayed in Ho Chi Minh City's District 7.
He frequented several ATMs of different banks to install a device which could collect PIN numbers and other card information, allowing him to collect bank card numbers when someone used an ATM, local media reported.
From October 7 to October 11 last year, several banks found that some of their customers' accounts had been compromised and the money withdrawn from different ATMs in the city.
Investigating police found that Todorvo was part of a Bulgarian group who had been stealing bank card information and using it to steal money with fake ATM cards that they made with another device.
Todorvo was detained October 10 when he went to the Tan Son Nhat Airport to leave Vietnam.
Police found that his laptop contained data from 121 bank accounts, including 98 from Vietnamese banks and the rest from outside the country.
According to info provided by several banks, at least 10 customers have been robbed off around VND87.5 million ($3,780) in total.
Their account information was found in Todorvo's laptop.
He denied accusations that he had stolen the money.
No information on other members in his group has been revealed.
Cancer-causing Ingredient in Chili Peppers Soothed by Ginger.
It's widely thought that ginger has health benefits — one of which may be to protect against an ingredient in chili peppers that has been linked to stomach cancer.
Both ginger and chili peppers are commonly used in Asian cuisine.
Chili peppers get their kick from capsaicin, which some research suggests also has plenty of health benefits.
But a diet rich in capsaicin has also been linked to stomach cancer.
Now, new research shows that one compound in ginger appears to offset the negative health effects of the chili pepper ingredient, and that used together, the two compounds might actually inhibit cancer growth.
Researchers at Pharmacy College of Henan University in China conducted a study with mice prone to lung cancer.
Over the course of several weeks, they fed the mice either capsaicin or 6-gingerol or both.
China surprises economists with GDP rise of 7%.
Following weeks of stock market turmoil, China has confounded expectations that its economic growth would slow further in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising by 7%.
Analysts had widely predicted that economic growth would dip from 7% in the first quarter to around 6.8% in the second.
However, GDP held steady, officials from China's National Bureau of Statistics claimed on Wednesday morning.
The figure still represents the lowest level of growth since the 2009 global financial crisis but is in line with Beijing's official target for 2015 of around 7%.
The announcement of stable second quarter growth surprised analysts, offered a boost to Beijing's attempts to soften the country's economic slowdown and came after weeks of chaos in the Chinese stock market which saw more than $3tn wiped off shares.
However, there were immediate doubts over the growth figure's reliability with the announcement sparking renewed debate over the trustworthiness of Beijing's statistics.
China's premier, Li Keqiang, tried to put a brave face on the recent stock market collapse during a meeting on Friday with economists and business leaders in Beijing.
However, Beijing has faced criticism for its handling of the crash.
Chinese president Xi Jinping has vowed to reduce Beijing's role in the economy but as stocks plunged earlier this month the Communist party took drastic measures, including temporarily halting initial public offerings.

Bkav to launch low-cost cell phones.
Local Internet security firm Bkav on June 10 announced its plan to manufacture low-cost mobile phones priced at less than VND1 million.
The production of the Bkav Smart Feature Phone 4G-C85 is aimed at supplying the local market with cell phones with 4G Internet connections at affordable prices.
The economical cell phones are set to be rolled out in July.

The new cell phones will run on the KaiOS operating system.
To offer the Bkav Smart Feature Phone 4G at less than VND1 million, Bkav will join hands with a major telecom carrier to subsidize the price, said Nguyen Ba Co, sales manager of Bkav.
The firm's cooperation with the telecom carrier is expected to expand its manufacturing operations to serve various customers, he added.
he noted, Bkav has been selling mid- and high-end products, so it is about time the firm entered into the low-cost cell phone segment.
Illegal hormone supply places transgender Vietnamese at risk.
To An has spent the last decade reliant on feminizing hormones smuggled to Vietnam after her gender reassignment surgery (GRS).
I consulted several hospitals in Saigon, but was rejected due to a lack of professionalism.
I was stuck and considered suicide, To An recalled.
In 2009, a gay man from Thailand told her about a medicine that could give users smoother skin, develop their breasts, and stop facial hair from growing.
After receiving her order, To An asked a friend to help her with the injection, not considering the side effects.
According to the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI), there are around 300,000 to 500,000 transgender Vietnamese, with 70 percent using hormones purchased from acquaintances, the Internet, or, like To An, the black market.
There is no pharmacy or medical facility providing hormone therapy to transgender Vietnamese, who have to rely on unprescribed hormones that often cause a host of side-effects.
Most miracle effect testosterone and estrogen hormones are imported illegally from Thailand, Germany, and India, their origins completely unknown.
In the past three months, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen international flights to Vietnam halted, leaving transgender Vietnamese in the lurch.
According to To An, many of her friends, who seldom stockpile hormones, are currently reliant on birth control pills.
The lack of supply is only one dilemma.
For many years, To An's friends have helped her inject hormones, mostly on a trial-and-error basis.
Once, following an injection in her buttock that caught infection, she had to be rushed to hospital for life-saving surgery, leaving her body permanently scarred.
After a near bleed-out, Truc Quan, 21, has been self-injecting estrogen bought online for eight months, extremely conscious of the many risks involved.
According to Doctor Nguyen Van Phung, plastic surgery lecturer at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam has no laws governing hormone therapy or GRS for its transgender populace.
Common side-effects of hormone injection include embolism, osteoporosis, hypertension, and allergy.
Using unprescribed medication can be even more dangerous.
If facing complications related to hormone treatment or GRS, transgender citizens should immediately attend hospital, the doctor stressed.
Quan, having learnt her lesson, now periodically visits a clinic to receive a hormone injection.
she said, I hope my friends learn about the side-effects of hormone treatment, find a doctor, or someone with a medical background to assist them.

PM approves reopening of karaoke parlors, dance clubs.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has given the green light to reopen karaoke parlors and dance clubs across the country as Vietnam has managed to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
Addressing a Government meeting this morning, June 9, Phuc tasked the Ministry of Public Security and relevant agencies with tightening control on violations and crimes at karaoke parlors and dance clubs after they reopen, especially the trade and use of heroin.
To help the tourism and aviation sectors recover, the prime minister asked the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control to identify countries or regions that have not reported new Covid-19 cases over the past 30 days so that Vietnam can resume flights to these regions.
Ministries, government departments and local authorities should still be watchful, especially in border areas, at border gates and at airports, Phuc said.
Karaoke parlors and dance clubs are the last nonessential services allowed to reopen.
Other nonessential services such as beauty salons, barbershops, and gyms have been reopened since May 7.
As of this afternoon, Vietnam had reported no new Covid-19 cases in the community for 54 consecutive days.
National Day holiday extension proposed as tourism boost.
The Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) has suggested that this year's National Day holiday in September be extended from Wednesday to the weekend.
This year, the national holiday falls on a Wednesday, and many localities and over 30 businesses have said the holiday could be extended for the rest of that week to commemorate the 75th National Day and promote domestic tourism, VNAT head Nguyen Trung Khanh said on Tuesday.
Ha Tat Thang, head of the Department of Labor Safety, which is an advisory agency for annual holidays under the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, said he has not received any official document with such a suggestion from the tourism sector.
Recovering from the epidemic, all businesses want to focus on restoring production.
Each sector will have its own direction, but everything should serve the same interest, he said, adding that he would discuss the proposal with the labor ministry once he receives an official document.
Whether the holiday would be extended or not would be decided by the government, he said.
Of a total of 14 public holidays in Vietnam this year, there's only one left, which is the National Day.
Starting 2021, Vietnamese will enjoy an extra day off for the National Day holiday, either on September 1 or September 3.

Northern Vietnam faces the longest heat wave in 27 years.
A heat wave impacting Hanoi and northern provinces since May 31 is expected to become the longest to have hit the region in over two decades.
High temperatures in northern provinces like Lang Son, Bac Ninh, Bac Giang, Hai Duong, Hung Yen, Ha Nam, and Ninh Binh were recorded at 39 degrees Celsius on Monday while those in Hanoi and Hoa Binh reached 40 degrees Celsius, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
The heat wave is forecast to linger until June 13 and may become the longest to have hit northern Vietnam since 1993.
Nguyen Van Huong, head of the weather forecasting department at the center, said widespread heat waves since 1993 had only lasted five to seven days.
The average temperatures in northern localities in the coming days are expected to reach 36 to 39 degrees Celsius.
American forecast services provider AccuWeather said the temperature in Hanoi would reach 38 degrees Celsius and remains at 35-36 until this weekend.
At 1 p.m Monday, all monitoring stations recorded temperatures above 37 with a scorching hot sun.
The highest is Lang area at 39, Ha Dong District at 38.5, Hoai Duc and Son Tay Districts at 38.
The heat wave was caused by low-pressure areas from the west and the Foehn wind, a type of dry, warm and down-slope wind that occurs in the lee of a mountain range, Huong said.
Experts have advised residents to avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 10 a.m and 3 p.m and to wear sunscreen, sunglasses and brimmed hats if venturing out under the sun.
Central Vietnam has been impacted by similar scorching weather over the past 10 days.
The heat is expected to continue in the region until June 16.
It is quite common for a heat wave to last 17 to 18 days in central Vietnam.
The most intense heat wave to have struck the region occurred in 2015, lasting for up to 39 days.
The National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting has warned of high risks of fire and explosion at local residential areas and forests due to the hot and dry weather.
Vietnam has been going through scorching days since early May.
On May 21, Hanoi's Ha Dong District experienced a record 40.9 degrees Celsius, the highest May temperature since 1961.
On the same day, parts of Lao Cai, Hoa Binh and Ha Giang also recorded their highest May temperatures in decades.
Last year, Vietnam went through possibly the hottest summer in history with average temperatures 0.5-1 degrees Celsius higher than previously, climbing to an average 39-42 degrees Celsius in many parts of the country.
The nation broke its highest temperature record on April 20 as the mercury hit 43.4 degrees Celsius, or 110 degrees Fahrenheit, in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province in central Vietnam.
Vietnam could host AFF Cup on its own.
Vietnam could end up hosting the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Cup 2020 on its own thanks to its effective handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) General Secretary Le Hoai Anh affirmed last weekend that a single host was one of the options being considered by the AFF.
In an official announcement last week, the ASEAN federation affirmed that it won't be postponing the championship until 2021 as earlier planned, and the tournament will take place from November 25 to December 31, soon after the World Cup 2022 qualifiers.
The AFF Cup had introduced the new format of having home and away matches for each team from the group stage to the final in 2018.
Anh said Vietnam has not received any official notice from the AFF about changing the tournament format, but added that anything can happen in the current situation.
If the AFF Cup opts to have the tournament played in just one country, Vietnam stands a great chance to host it because it would be considered a safe location after its demonstrated success in containing the pandemic.
Vietnam is the only country in Southeast Asia to have restarted its football tournaments and opened up stadiums for spectators.
The National Cup commenced May 23, making it the first football tournament to make a comeback after Vietnam eased its social distancing campaigns late April.
The match between Duoc Nam Ha Nam Dinh (Nam Dinh FC) and Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL FC) saw 10,000 spectators fill half of the Thien Truong Stadium in Nam Dinh Province, an event that made international headlines.

The cave, which has a total length of 9 kilometers, was declared as the world's largest and it opened to tourists in 2013, four years after members of the British Cave Research Association finished their exploration.
Now, Son Doong, part of the Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park, a UNESCO heritage site, is a fast-emerging tourist destination in the country.

Vietnamese pop singers are interested in traditional topics.
Vietnamese pop singers are broaching traditional topics in a brave new way, sparking off lively debates.
The two most notable recent songs are by Hoa Minzy and Bich Phuong.
Hoa Minzy's ambitious nine-minute ballad musical video titled Khong The Cung Nhau Suot Kiep (Can't Be Together Forever) provides a glimpse into the historical, gender-charged love story between Vietnam's last emperor, Bao Dai, and his wife, Empress Nam Phuong.
Nam Phuong was wedded to Bao Dai in an unprecedented marriage which required but didn't receive permission from the Roman Catholic Church because she was a Catholic and he was not.
She was consecrated as empress or the emperor's first wife right away, a patriarchal honor rarely bestowed on the concubines of the Nguyen Dynasty.
Nam Phuong went on to have five children with her husband.
Bao Dai, however, had other wives as well as extramarital affairs.
It is Nam Phuong's reaction upon discovering her husband's change of heart that is artistically treated in Hoa Minzy's MV.
Released on YouTube on May 13, Không Thể Cùng Nhau Suốt Kiếp has been widely lauded for its meticulous directing and scripting.
Within three days the MV went on to become the No.1 clip on YouTube Vietnam's Top Trending after attracting over 10 million views.
It has now garnered over 22 million views, many more likes than dislikes, and a lot of positive comments.
Hoang Thuy Linh has a bunch of EDM songs that make creative use of Vietnamese culture such as her 2019 hit De Mi Noi Cho Ma Nghe (Let Mi Tell You), which was inspired by 20th-century writer To Hoai's short story Vo Chong A Phu (A Phu and His Wife) about a couple living in the northwestern mountains during the French resistance.
Many MVs find inspiration in Vietnamese history, literature and folk culture has become a clever strategy for Vietnamese singers.

Fruit exporters hit by rising air freight costs.
Vietnamese fruit exporters are struggling since air freight costs are surging due to the limited number of flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Global Fresh Fruit Company Ltd of Ben Tre Province has seen exports fall by half in the last two months despite high demand from overseas buyers.
Its CEO, Phung Van Hien, said logistics companies are demanding two to four times the freight they did at the end of 2019.
Rates for shipping to the Middle East have surged from $1.5-1.8 per kilogram to $6, and freight to Australia has also increased, he said.
Nguyen Dinh Tung, CEO of Vina T&T, one of the largest Vietnamese exporters of fruits to the U.S., told local media the cost of shipping has increased from the regular $3.2 to $5.4.
The Vietnam Fruit and Vegetables Association (Vinafruit) said the pandemic has caused a major challenge to Vietnam's export of fruits, pointing out that the number of flights to the U.S and Australia has dropped from 30 per week earlier to 10 now.
Vietnam's fruit exports this year are down 21 percent to $1.1 billion, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Exporters have been turning to shipment by sea, but this is only suitable for fruits that do not perish soon like coconut, durian, and dragon fruit.
Fruits such as longan and lychee cannot endure long shipping durations.
Exports of vegetables and fruits were worth $3.7 billion last year, with China being the largest buyer, according to the ministry.
JICA inspects progress of HCMC's first metro line.
The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is funding HCMC's first metro line, held a meeting with the HCMC Management Authority for Urban Railways (MAUR) on June 3 to discuss the progress of the project.
The JICA delegation, led by Junko Takahashi, senior representative at the JICA Vietnam Office, and MAUR leaders also discussed the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, capital disbursement, the financial situation and the implementation of contracts for major packages of the metro line that will link Ben Thanh Market in District 1 and Suoi Tien Theme Park in District 9.
Addressing the meeting, Bui Xuan Cuong, director of MAUR, thanked JICA for its support and asked the agency to continue cooperating with the authority over major tasks for 2020 including capital disbursement, refunding payments and dealing with the challenges caused by the Covid-19 outbreak.
Cuong also requested the Japanese Government to assist Vietnam in importing trains for the metro line and the travel of Japanese experts to the country.
Work on the 19.7-kilometer metro line began in August 2012.
The line has 2.6 kilometers of underground track and over 17 kilometers of the elevated track as well as three underground and 11 elevated stations.
The metro line is more than 70% complete, and MAUR said it is accelerating the progress of components such as the installation of the tracks, lighting and signal systems and equipment at the stations.
It expects to complete 85% of the metro line by the end of this year and put it into service in late 2021.
British Covid-19 patient is fully conscious.
Vietnam's most severe case of Covid-19, the 91st patient, is fully conscious and able to respond to all instructions from health workers, said a representative from HCMC's Cho Ray Hospital, where the patient is being treated.
The British patient, who works as a pilot for the national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, smiled when health workers were interacting with him.
He could also feebly nod and shake the hands of the health workers, the hospital representative said at 7 p.m on June 2.
According to doctors at the hospital, his respiratory functions have gradually improved, while his kidney functions have also recovered.
His blood oxygen level remains stable.
The doctors have weaned him off an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine for two days, which is a life support machine used when a patient's heart and lungs fail to function properly.
However, he has to rely on a ventilator.
As for the patient's lungs, more than half of his left lung has almost recovered, while the right lung is showing signs of improvement.
The hospital representative said that the patient would continue to take antibiotics to treat his infection from Burkholderia cenocepacia, a type of bacteria, as well as to prevent other bacterial infections.
He has also begun physical therapy.

Vietnam launches second mobile virtual network operator.
A second mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) called Reddi was introduced to the local market on June 3 by operator Mobicast, with the 055 prefix.
The network will use the mobile phone infrastructure of the State-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) to offer services to its customers.
To date, there are five traditional mobile network carriers in the country, namely Viettel, MobiFone, VNPT, Vietnamobile and Gtel.
As the latest addition to the local mobile network market, Reddi stressed that it would target young and modern customers and offer them telecom and digital services through mobile apps.
Reddi will not offer services at competitive prices but will focus on the customer experience.
The operator Mobicast noted that it would coordinate with digital service providers to offer Reddi customers new and personalized technology services.
One year ago, the country's first mobile virtual network called ITelecom was introduced with the numeral prefix 087.
At the launch ceremony, its operator Dong Duong Telecom Company said ITelecom would tap the niche market and provide mobile network services to workers in industrial zones.
However, ITelecom has not released its business performance results since the launch.
Data from the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications revealed that there are some 126 million mobile subscriptions in Vietnam but the average revenue earned from each subscription remains low at some VND100,000 per month.
Accordingly, experts in the field said the current fierce competitive market does not leave much room for mobile virtual networks to grow.
Le Dang Dung, chairman of military-run telecom carrier Viettel, told the Saigon Times that MVNOs see success only in European countries where the average revenue generated from each mobile subscription is high.
In Vietnam, MVNOs will struggle to compete with existing traditional mobile network operators since the average expenditures on mobile services in Vietnam are already low at VND70,000-VND90,000 per month.
Moreover, MVNOs can only survive when traditional mobile network carriers have yet to own widespread sales channels.
In reality, local telecom carriers have established their business operations nationwide with a large number of both offline and online stores, he added.
MPS steps up investigation into bribery case at Tenma.
The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) has ordered the Bac Ninh Province police to work with Japanese firm Tenma in the investigation of a bribery scandal involving 25 million yen to escape tax duties.
Speaking at a regular Government press briefing on June 2, Major General To An Xo, head of the office of the ministry, said that the prime minister had directed the Ministries of Finance and Public Security to launch a thorough probe into the case.
While the investigation is being conducted by the Ministry of Finance, the MPS has asked the Bac Ninh police to verify the information and collect the relevant paperwork and documentary evidence, Xo said.
The ministry also requested several relevant agencies to contact the Japanese firm over paperwork related to the case, the local media reported.

Late disbursement said to be reason for Chinese contractor's capital demand.
The Chinese contractor stated that the late disbursement of funds in the Cat Linh-Ha Dong railway project prompted it to demand US$50 million to pay the subcontractors and experts.
On June 3, Tang Hong, director of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong metro project, said that since February, the capital disbursement for the project was yet to be done, hindering the Chinese contractor from paying the subcontractors.
While most of the project equipment has been completed, Hong noted that the payment for the workload was yet to be made, VnExpress news site reported.
The Chinese contractor asked the Railway Project Management Unit to pay US$50 million, in line with the provisions of the contract at an online meeting in May so that it could make payments to contractors, subcontractors and experts while operating the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway on a trial basis.
This is the payment for the construction workload in accordance with the engineering, procurement and construction contract but not the increased costs, Hong said.
Meanwhile, Vu Hong Phuong, director of the Railway Project Management Unit, said that the documents sent to the unit by the Chinese contractor were not eligible, so the unit could not make any payment.
Lower growth trend brews for Vietnam beer industry.
Vietnam's strict implementation of drunk driving laws and other factors will dampen the beer market this year.
A recent report by the Vietnam Industry Research And Consultancy (VIRAC) says this will be a trend in coming years despite the fact that a million people become newly eligible to consume alcohol each year.
The report estimates an annual growth of 6-7 percent for the domestic beer industry.
It notes that the industry's stock value dropped by nearly 13 percent last year and says small businesses are likely to be most affected by the drop in growth.
In 2019, Vietnam consumed more than 4.6 billion liters of beer, an increase of more than 10 percent over the previous year.
According to Germany-based data portal Statista, beer sales revenue rose 6.88 percent year-on-year to around $7.75 billion.
The main reason for the industry slump is Decree 100, which took effect on January 1 this year, imposing stiff penalties for drunk driving.
Those riding bicycles and electric bikes will also be fined for this.
Motorcyclists and car drivers can be fined VND6-8 million and VND30-40 million ($1,300-1,725), double the old levels and have their licenses suspended for 22-24 months.
Covid-19 pandemic is also said to likely contribute to slower growth this year.
The reports noted that Vietnam's export markets, including China and Southeast Asian countries, are experiencing high growth in food and beverage consumption.
Equatorial Guinea in Africa is Vietnam's biggest export market, accounting for 20 percent.
Vietnam's export beer output in 2019 is estimated at 46 million liters valued at $45.87 million.
Big C Mien Dong to close down.
Thailand's Central Retail, which manages and operates the Big C supermarket chain in Vietnam, announced yesterday that it will shut down the Big C Mien Dong in HCMC's District 10 in the next 20 days, as it has failed to reach an agreement on the site lease with the landlord.
Given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Thai retailer has made efforts to reach an agreement over the extension of the contract with the site lessor to maintain normal operations at the supermarket and support local consumers during the post-Covid-19 period, according to a Central Retail representative.
However, new suggestions from the lessor over the contract extension have left the retailer unable to fulfill its commitment to offer products at low prices to consumers, following which it decided to cease operating the supermarket.
After the shutdown, employees of Big C Mien Dong will continue to work at other Big C stores, the representative added.
Aside from Big C Mien Dong, other Big C supermarkets under the Central Retail Vietnam in HCMC include Big C Truong Chinh, Big C Au Co, Big C Phu Thanh, Big C An Phu and GO! Market.
The Thai retailer said that it will adopt measures to minimize the inconveniences caused to the loyal customers of Big C Mien Dong by continuously offering them shopping and direct-to-site delivery services via the hotline 1900 1880 or through online shopping apps such as Chopp and GrabMart.
Big C Mien Dong, which is located on To Hien Thanh Street, is among the first Big C supermarkets that French retailer Casino launched in the local market in 2003.
Big C was then rebranded as Cora following an M&A deal between two French retailers.
From 2016 onward, the Big C Vietnam supermarket chain was officially owned by Thailand's Central Group.

British Covid-19 patient smiles after two months in coma.
A British man who is Vietnam's most critical Covid-19 patient so far smiled as doctors talked to him on Tuesday.
The Covid-19 treatment sub-committee under the Health Ministry said his smile carries a lot of meaning, showing that he has been more conscious.
The digestive system of the patient, a 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot designated as patient 91, has also improved as his abdominal distension has reduced.
His kidney functions have recovered and he has been able to move his hands and legs.
The patient has developed a stronger cough reflex.
His pulmonary ventilation has become more stable.
However, he still has to rely on the life support extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system.
The blood flowing through his ECMO currently stays at 3.7 liters per minute, and doctors are working to gradually reduce the system's oxygen flow to 1.5 liters per minute.
Previously, while he was still in a severely critical condition, the oxygen flow could go up to 5.7 liters per minute.
On Monday, doctors at the Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City where the patient is treated have started letting him have physical therapy twice a day.
Tran Thanh Linh, deputy head of the emergency department at the hospital, said an X-ray image of his lungs on May 25 revealed tissue or fluid blocking blood vessels in both lungs but the one taken on Tuesday showed that more than half of the left lung has recovered from such situation.
His muscle weakness has also been improved.
This is the right time to reduce his dependence on the ECMO, he said.
Earlier, the patient had suffered from the cytokine storm syndrome, which happened when his immune system overreacted to the novel coronavirus attacking the body, releasing too many cytokines, damaging his organs.
For now, he is still infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia, a type of opportunistic bacteria, and doctors said it is difficult to treat.
Vietnam has recorded 328 Covid-19 cases so far.
Vietnam passport ranks low in global ranking.
Vietnam is one of the least powerful passports in the world, ranking 157th among 199, says a report released Tuesday by Nomad Capitalist.
The global offshore consulting firm ranked 199 economies in terms of passport strength based on five categories. visa-free travel, international taxation laws, global perception, dual citizenship and personal freedom.
Vietnam's low ranking in the Nomad Passport Index 2020 reflects the fact that Vietnamese passport holders can only travel visa-free to 54 countries and territories, slightly more than Laos in Southeast Asia with 50, the Hong Kong-based firm said.
Vietnam also scored poorly in terms of global perception and level of personal freedom of citizens, travelers and expats, the report said.
In Southeast Asia, Singapore has the most powerful passport with visa free access to 190 destinations and a high level of personal freedom, followed by Malaysia with 178 countries.
Nine of the ten top passports were from Europe, with Singapore being the only non-European country to break into the top ten.
The Swedish passport was the most powerful with visa-free access to 186 countries and territories, high levels of personal freedom and an excellent global reputation.
The worst passport was from Afghanistan, with visa free access to just 26 destinations.
With the Donald Trump administration pursuing a hostile immigration policy, the U.S lost its throne as the most powerful passport in the world, slipping down to 40th rank.
According to Mastercard, Vietnam has the second fastest growing outbound market in the Asia Pacific region after Myanmar, with projected annual growth of 9.5 percent between 2016 and 2021.
The firm forecast some 7.5 million Vietnamese travelers would venture outside the country in 2021.

Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Ngoc Dong stated that the Chinese contractor's demand of US$50 million for the trial operation of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi City would not be considered by the Ministry of Transport as it goes against the provisions of the contract.
Stressing that the demand was not made in an official document, the deputy minister told the local media on June 2 that the Chinese side demanded US$50 million for the trial operation of the railway during certain online meetings held between them and the Railway Project Management Unit.
The payments for the railway project have been made by the Vietnamese side in accordance with the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract, the deputy minister noted.
In case the Chinese contractor sends a document requesting the capital, the demand will not be considered as it goes against the contract, Dong added.
Under the contract, even if the Chinese contractor suffers from financial difficulties during this time, they will have to run a trial operation, Dong remarked, adding that the Vietnamese side will not bear responsibility for any additional payment.

Vietnamese fabric exports excluded from Indonesia's new tariffs.
Indonesia's Ministry of Finance has imposed new tariffs on imports, effective from May to November 2022, to protect its local manufacturers due to the rising imports of fabric, fibers, and curtains, but Vietnamese fabric being imported into Indonesia is not subject to the new taxes.
Under the Indonesian ministry's Decree 56/2020, the levels of self-defense taxes are at 1,405 rupiah or US$0.93 per kilogram from May 27 to November 8, at 1,193 rupiah per kilogram from November 9 to November 8, 2021 and at 979 rupiah per kilogram from November 9, 2021, to November 8, 2022, according to VietnamPlus news site.
Several countries and territories, including Hong Kong and South Korea, are exempted from the new tariffs on synthetic fibers and curtains, while the fabric exports from India and Vietnam to Indonesia are not affected by the new taxes.
Last year, the Indonesian Government imposed temporary duties of up to 67.7% on textile and garment imports to protect its locally manufactured products and encourage domestic consumption.
Moody's has warned that the U.S.-Sino trade tensions will possibly prompt a shift in fabric, fibers and apparel products from China to Southeast Asia including Indonesia, hindering the stability of demand and supply and hurting local producers.
The United States has levied a 25% import tax on China's textiles and garments, higher than the levels of 10-15% being applied by Indonesia.

Chinese contractor demands US$50m for system operation of Cat Linh-Ha Dong project.
While the completion date of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi is not yet known and the inspection dossiers have not been completed, Chinese contractor China Railway 6 Bureau Group has requested US$50 million for the system operation before handing over the project.
The Railway Project Management Unit has reported the issue to the Ministry of Transport, noting that the payment must comply with the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract, according to Nguoi Lao Dong newspaper.

According to the Government, the completion date for the project has not yet been decided and the responsibilities of organizations and individuals for the slow progress have not been made clear. so, capital has not been allocated for the construction supervision package.
To address these obstacles, the Railway Project Management Unit suggested that the Ministry of Transport report the problems to the Government for solutions, extend the construction supervision package, and organize meetings with the Chinese contractor to discuss capital demand for the trial operation of the railway.

Trump on Friday pledged to take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory, and to impose sanctions on unspecified individuals over Beijing's new laws on the Asian financial centre.

Details of the laws remain unclear, even to Hong Kong officials, but are expected to be enacted by China's parliament this summer.

Vingroup has set its sights on car, smartphone exports to the U.S.
Planning to first conquer the most challenging market, Vingroup has set its sights on car, smartphone exports to the U.S.
If we could win over the most difficult market, we could easily enter others.
It's a test.
We need to set high goals for our startups, said Pham Nhat Vuong, chairman of the largest listed company in Vietnam, at a shareholder meeting Thursday.
He was referring to automaker VinFast and smartphone producer VinSmart, both subsidiaries identified as the company's new core businesses.
VinFast on Thursday tested its first electric car model in Hanoi in preparation for Los Angeles Auto Show in November.
Although the company does not release sales figures, official data shows 5,124 VinFast cars were registered in the first quarter, helping the auto brand rank fifth in Vietnam sales.
VinSmart has sold 1.2 million smartphones in 17 months to claim third place in Vietnam market share behind South Korea's Samsung and China's Oppo.
However, losses are expected for both companies in three to five years, Vuong warned.
For the next several years our target is not to profit but to dominate the market.
Vingroup, with a market cap of over $14 billion, has not been immune to coronavirus impacts.

The company aims to hit a revenue of VND145 trillion ($6.2 billion) this year, up 12 percent over 2019, and a post-tax profit of VND5 trillion ($214 million), down 35 percent.
Hanoi jails man who tricked two women into prostitution in China.
A man was sentenced to 19 years in jail Wednesday for his involvement in trafficking two women to China in 2005.
Dinh Van Dong, 52, was charged with human trafficking and trafficking of a person under 16, the Hanoi People's Court heard.
In 2005, Dong lent Nguyen Thi Thu Ha, 36, a certain amount of money to help her mother pay off a debt.
In return, Ha had to coerce two women from Hanoi to sell commodities in China on Dong's behalf, local media reported.
Visiting Hanoi in May 2005, Ha met a woman named Hang who helped her persuade two anonymous sisters, one aged under 16, to travel to China.
However, both sisters were subsequently sold into prostitution, earning Dong VND3 million ($128), and Ha and Hang VND14 million ($599).
Police opened an investigation after the sisters' parents reported that they went missing.
They soon arrested Ha, who in February 2006 was sentenced to 17 years in jail on the charges of human trafficking and trafficking of a person under 16.
Dong was arrested in September last year.
Hang's whereabouts remain unknown.
The sisters have not been rescued.
Vietnam is a human trafficking and illegal migration hotspot with annual profits worth tens of billions of dollars, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
The country has recorded over 3,400 victims of human trafficking since 2013, over 90 percent of them women, children and people from ethnic minority communities, Nguyen Xuan Lap, head of the ministry's Department of Social Issues Prevention, said at a conference in November last year.
VinFast test runs electric car for launch at US show.
Automaker VinFast has tested its first electric car model in Hanoi with plans to introduce it in a U.S auto show later this year.
VinFast plans to launch the car at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November before promoting it in different countries in January next year.
It plans to start mass production in July next year.
The car is designed by Italy's Pininfarina, which also designed VinFast's first SUV and sedan.
The car is set to have a 470 horsepower engine and be able to run 500 kilometers on full charge.
VinFast is developing its own batteries for the vehicle using cells from South Korea's LG company.
VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest company Vingroup, started delivering its first cars in June last year.
The company does not release sales figures, but official data shows that 5,124 VinFast cars were registered in the first quarter.
This puts it in the fifth place in sales, behind Hyundai, Toyota, Kia and Honda.
Coronavirus deaths in US top 100,000.
Health officials say the actual death toll is likely far higher than the recorded count.
The US has passed 100,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak in less than four months.
It has seen more fatalities than any other country, while its 1.69 million confirmed infections account for about 30% of the worldwide total.
The first US infection was reported in Washington state on 21 January.
Globally there have been 5.6 million people recorded as infected and 354,983 deaths since the virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
The US death toll stands at 100,276, according to Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, which has been tracking the pandemic.
It means that around as many Americans have died from Covid-19 than from the Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
But on a per capita basis the US ranks ninth in its mortality rate behind the likes of Belgium, the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, according to the university.
British Covid-19 patient moves out of two-month coma.
Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient regained consciousness Wednesday after doctors reduced his sedation doses.
Patient 91, a 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot in Ho Chi Minh City, has started having cough responses, could move the tips of his fingers, make basic communication and follow doctors' simple instructions, said Doctor Nguyen Tri Thuc, director of Cho Ray Hospital.
Thuc said this development happened two days after doctors stopped using muscle relaxants on him and gradually reduced his sedation dosage.
His thoracic diaphragm and limbs, however, remained weak or paralyzed.
Doctors also stopped dialysis again after having restored the treatment for 24 hours.
The patient's condition is still severely critical, but his awareness, blood oxygen level and kidney functions have improved compared to two days earlier, the doctor said.
According to a treatment sub-committee set up by the Health Ministry, X-ray images of the patient's lungs Wednesday afternoon showed small improvement, and doctors have reduced the blood flow through the ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) system from 4.5 liters per minute last Friday to 4 liters per minute.
ECMO is a technique that pumps blood out of the body and to a heart-lung machine that removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back.
While the patient's lung functions have shown improvements, these are still not enough, Thuc said.
He would still have to undergo treatment for his lung infection with the goal of gradually reducing his reliance on the ECMO system.
The patient is scheduled to have a third chest CT scan Thursday afternoon for an evaluation of his lung recovery.
The health ministry sub-committee, Cho Ray Hospital's doctors and experts from major hospitals across the country would hold an online consultation Friday to agree on the next treatment plan for the patient, a pilot employed by Vietnam Airlines at the time he was confirmed infected.
Earlier, the patient had suffered from the cytokine storm syndrome, which happened when his immune system overreacted to the novel coronavirus attacking the body, releasing too many cytokines, damaging his organs.
The Vietnam Airlines pilot was the first case in the cluster of infections in HCMC associated with the Buddha Bar & Grill, a major outbreak site in the southern metropolis.
A few days after he was diagnosed, 18 others were also found infected.
