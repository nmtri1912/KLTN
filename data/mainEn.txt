The 45th President of the United States of America – Donald Trump, he beaten off one of the former President’s wife named Hilary Clinton and has taken office on January 20, 2017.
Actually, he has already risen to fame as a business magnate and TV personality far before he moves to live in the White House.
However, unlike other previous ones, this President has been frequently criticized and hit the headlines.
As he took up office, Trump immediately managed to hobble Obamacare – one of the biggest achievements of his previous, President Obama.
The action made public opinion break out, and people not only in the USA but also in the world called him the cruel guy.
Obamacare was an act that make health insurance available for US citizens, especially the poor, and its official name of the law is the Affordable Care Act.
However, President Trump considered this act completely the opposite with one of important American values, independence, which means that the America, regardless of the rich of the poor, must be self-reliant and depends on no one to feed and finance them.
As a result, he got rid of this law and was strongly censured.
Recently, President Donald Trump has grabbed the headlines of many magazines regardless inside or outside the USA for throwing a grenade triggering the commercial war between his nation and China.
The press acknowledged that he is hobbling China because this nation’s economy is getting bigger and might gulp his USA down in a near future.
However, it is true that this trade war is the economic sanctions after mischief and tricks China did not only with the business but also the politics of America.
It is not wrong for people to say that he is evil, but he just does the right things and protects the Americans.
Kim Jong Un is the Supreme Leader of North Korea who has been in power since 2011.
Although he has been well-known recently, his life is still a mystery to the world.
He was born in the early 1980s to singer Ko Young Hee and North Korea dictator Kim Jong Il, and his grandfather was Kim Il Sung – founder of the Kim dynasty.
Though Kim Jong Un had an elder brother and half-brother, his father still chose him as his successor.
After his father’s death in 2011, Kim ascended to power.
Unlike other presidents, Kim has a harsh and fierce policy of governance and leadership.
It is said that the leader of North Korea – Kim Jong Un is extremely cruel, dangerous but not crazy.
His pursuit of nuclear weapons, incendiary rhetoric and odd appearance prove to that saying.
Kim instructs his guys to create a very strong advanced and dangerous nuclear weapons that threaten the strongest nation in terms of military – the United States, and President Trump has to scratch his head over the nuclear weapon agreement with the two in order to persuade him uninstalling all of the booms.
This is the reason why we have the US – North Korean Singapore and Hanoi Summit.
Not only the military system is focused, but also all areas of daily life in North Korea which are strictly controlled by Kim’s regime is the topic of many discussions.
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is home to more than 24 million people living under a harsh form of communist rule.
People have to ask permission to travel around and it is difficult for visitors to enter the country.
All TVs and radios are tuned to state channels and people are caught listening to foreign broadcasts face harsh punishments.
These controls make most North Koreans have little or even no idea of the outside world, and it is seemed that these citizens are trapped in caged.
The world, especially Mr.Trump of the US are doing their best to make at least small changes to this country and help its people have chance to meet the outside.
Facebook is one of the most popular and biggest social media globally that most of the people worldwide use and access everyday.
It provide us with smart and convenient features that help us connect to the outside world without going anywhere but stay at home or office only;
morever, people nowadays can work and study or go shopping online at home via Facebook.
However, despite these brilliant features, it is argued that Facebook also has its own psychological costs that are bad for the human being’s mental health.
To be more specific concerning the side effects of the social medium – Facebook, firstly, it can become addictive and causes intense passivity and weak communication.
Besides society’s most common addictive substances like coffee, cigarettes, and alcohol, it is obviously that Facebook – a cyber phenomenon in the world – has been becoming a serious addiction got by people in all ages.
In fact, friends, families, colleagues and partners nowadays are no longer happy and excited in engaging a face-to-face conversation.
They even feel disconcerted because of having nothing to say with each other.
Intepreting for this strange and popular situation, Facebook is one of the reason that people have been blaming on.
Myriad people daily spend hours to browse Facebook, in other words, they are becoming phone heads or phone addicts.
Furthermore, the more people use Facebook, the more jealousy they get.
It is obvious that people are naturally inclined to engage in social comparison.
For more details, with just a glance at the New Feeds, people can updates from their social cycles;
when people see someone who has a happier or more successful life then theirs, such as a new fancy car or an expensive beautiful dress, not only can Facebook make them feel like they are not sharing in their friends’s happiness and success, but it can also make them feel envious of their friends’s wonderful life.
As these negative social comparisons happen and accumulate day in day out, human being will definitely get extremely depressed and anxious leading to the antisocial and autism syndromes that can cause a lot of serious consequences, especially the suicide.
Facebook can be awesomely good for humankind if they exploit it properly, and it can also precipitate extremely serious and unpredictable consequences if people excessively abuse and improperly employ it.
We all know that natural disasters happen all over the world, and they can be utterly devastating for people’s lives and the environments we live in.
There are many different natural causes leading to natural disasters, and being aware of these causes enables us to be better prepared when they do arrive.
One of the most common natural disasters is flooding, which occurs when a river bursts its banks and the water spills out onto the floodplain.
During wet periods, flood warnings are often put in place because of a great deal of heavy rain.
There are other risk factors for flooding that we have to mention such as steep-sided channels cause fast surface run-off, the lack of vegetation and woodland break the flow of water.
In other words, there is little to slow the floodwater down.
Earthquakes are another common natural disaster on the list that can cause many fatalities.
Earthquakes are caused by the movements of the plates in the earth’s crust.
These plates do not always move smoothly and can get stuck, and then cause a build-up of pressure – the reason why earthquake occur.
In addition to this, an earthquake under the water can also cause a tsunami by pushing large volumes of water to the surface causing great waves.
Tsunamis can also be caused by underwater volcanic eruptions which are another natural disaster caused by magma escaping from inside the earth.
An explosion takes place, releasing the magma from a confined space, and that is why huge quantities of gas and dust are always released during a volcanic eruption.
Inside of the volcano, the magma travels up and then pours out over the surrounding area as lava.
Last but not least, one of the most common natural disasters that we commonly forgot is wildfires.
They take place in many different countries all over the world, particularly during the summertime, and can be caused by a range of different reasons.
Some of the things starting the wildfires can be totally natural, while others can be manmade, but the speed they spread is entirely down to nature.
There are two main natural causes of wildfires which are the sun’s heat and lightning strikes.
Other reasons are campfires, smoking, fireworks and many other things caused by humans.
The reasons why they spread so quickly are prolonged hot, dry weather, where the vegetation dries out, which is why they often take place in woodland.
A huge portion of my early childhood memories is rather patchy and fuzzy where I barely recall the names and faces of my kindergarten teachers or classmates.
But the only thing that still stayed on with me from that period was the stories by Enid Blyton.
I could proudly say that I grew up with Blyton’s characters who accompanied me from my adolescence years well into my mid-elementary school years because her stories had varying levels of difficulty that catered to a wide group of readers.
For myself, this author opened up my young impressionable mind to different worlds, worlds that were magical and also culturally different.
For example, boarding schools are not common options in Singapore because for a tiny island like ours, my elementary school was only a 15-minute walk away from home.
Yet through the Malory Towers series, I knew more about how other children lived in other areas of the world.
As compared to watching cartoon, her stories left children much more room for imagination and creative thinking.
I conjured images about how Moon-face and Saucepan Man from the Faraway Tree series might look like and what color would an elf’s clothes be.
In my mind, elves were never as raggedy as Dobby in Harry Potter or as suave as Legolas in Lord of The Rings.
Instead, they were diminutive in stature, slender with sharp ears and friendly almond eyes wearing grey clothes.
After more than a decade of outgrowing Blyton’s books, I am deeply and truely impressed that she was able to articulate thoughts suitable for a child.
Being an author or writer, it is imperative to write in a way clearly understood by the readers.
As such, children authors need to simplify their thoughts and articulate using grammar and vocabulary appropriate for different age groups.
As an adult, one could imagine the difficulties to be a children’s author, much less a successful and timeless one for requires us to stop thinking like a grown-up and adopt the children’s psyche.
The Earth is very old.
It has changed often during its long life, and it is still changing.
Millions of years ago, when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex were alive, the Earth was much warmer.
There was very little ice on the land or on the sea, even in the very north or the very south of the world.
And the sea was much higher than it is today.
There have been many changes since that time, sometimes to a warmer climate, sometimes to a colder one.
About 20,000 years ago, for example, a time called an Ice Age began.
There was ice over much of the world, and it was 3 kilometres deep over much of North America and Europe.
And the sea was not as high as it is today.
Our climate has changed many times, and it will change again.
But now, for the very first time, people are changing the climate.
In the year 1900, the Earth was 0.
7 C colder than it was in 2000, just one hundred years later.
This change did not happen because of the Earth’s orbit – it happened because of us.
Some people think that this is a small change.
But think about this.
A change of just 5 to 7 C can start or finish an Ice Age.
Can the climate change like this?
Scientists think that it can – but not as quickly as this.
Scientists do not always agree.
Some think that the climate is changing a lot, and some think that it is changing a little.
Some think that it will change quickly, and some slowly.
But all scientists agree that climate change is happening.
The important question is this: how dangerous will the change be?
Al Gore, who worked next to President Clinton of the USA between 1993 and 2001, thinks that the change will be dangerous.
In his film An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore describes how the Earth’s climate has changed.
He has talked about the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years, but is he right?
Is climate change a dangerous problem?
Must we do something about it?
And what can we do?
One out of every two marriages nowadays ends in divorce and lots of divorcing families include children.
Parents who are obtaining a divorce are usually worried about the impact the divorce will have on their children.
During this difficult period, parents may be absorbed with their own problems, but continue to be the most important people in their children’s lives.
While parents may be ravaged or relieved by the divorce, children are constantly frightened and confused by the threat to their security.
Some parents feel so overwhelmed or hurt by the divorce that they may turn to the child for direction or comfort.
Divorce could be misinterpreted by children unless parents tell them what is happening, how they are involved and not involved, and what will happen to them.
Talking to children about a divorce is difficult.
The following tips can help both the young and the old with the challenge and stress of these conversations:Don’t keep it a secret or wait until the last minute.
Tell your child together with your spouse.
Keep things simple and straight-forward.
Inform them the divorce is not their fault.
Admit that this will be upsetting and sad for everyone.
Reassure your child that you both still love them and will be their parents forever.
Do not discuss each other’s faults or problems with the child.
Children will do best if they know that their mother and father will still be their parents and remain involved with them even though the marriage is ending and the parents won’t live together.
Pressure on a child to "choose" sides or long custody disputes can be particularly harmful for the youngster and can add to the damage of the divorce.
Research indicates that children do best when parents can cooperate on behalf of the child.
Parents’ ongoing commitment to the child’s well-being is vital.
If a child shows signs of distress, the family doctor or pediatrician can refer the parents to a child and adolescent psychiatrist for evaluation and treatment.
In addition, the child and adolescent psychiatrist can meet with the parents to help them learn how to make the strain of the divorce easier on the entire family.
Psychotherapy for the children of a divorce, and the divorcing parents, can be helpful.
Vietnam is a tropical country located in Southeast Asia – the center of the world sea-route.
The tropical monsoon climate gives Vietnam resource-rich biological diversity.
Besides, Vietnam has S shape with 3620 kilometers of the coast with abundant tourism and seafood potentialities.
Vietnam has a long-lasting history with over four thousand years through the ups and downs of history and politics.
There are 54 ethnic groups in total and the Kinh is the largest one.
All the ethnic groups all over the country live peacefully under a common roof – Vietnam.
Vietnam is a country with special cultures, one of which is the Tet holiday.
From the first Dynasty of Vietnam (the Hung King Dynasty), our ancestors celebrated Tet Holiday every year.
Tet is the biggest holiday in Vietnam, which is held according to the Lunar Calendar.
In the Tet, we cooked Banh Chung and Banh Giay, two special dishes made from sticky rice as Vietnam is an agriculture country.
Banh Chung is wrapped in square-shaped – the symbolic meaning of the earth, land, sun, men.
Banh Giay is wrapped in circle-shaped – the symbolic meaning of the ocean, sky, moon, women.
Banh Chung and Banh Giay together are the symbol of the harmony of the universe.
Thousand years have passed and this nice cultural feature has been kept until now.
Vietnamese people are friendly, intelligent, hard-working and thirsty for moving up.
You might think that Vietnam is a small country, but we never step back.
Far back in history, we proved it.
Throughout the ups and downs of history, we have defeated a lot of strong enemies from different lands.
In the wartime, both the French and the USA army became our defeaters.
Nowadays, we are building our country to become richer, more beautiful as the strong wish from Mr.Ho Chi Minh.
The MOONCAKE is a traditional Chinese pastry which is enjoyed during the annual Mid-Autumn festival by many people around the world.
The name "mooncake" comes from this festival, since families gather to celebrate this lunar festival and watch the full moon.
MOONCAKES are also an iconic Chinese dessert with a colorful history dating back thousands of years.
MOONCAKES are baked into round shapes, but varies in sizes and the varied ingredients based on different areas’ interpretation.
It is commonly made with a thin crust, thick sweet filling from lotus seed paste, and contains two yolks from salted duck eggs.
The round duck egg yolks perform the full moon.
The top layer of the mooncake includes symbols of the moon festival imprinted on them or is also decorated to have good luck characters.
The Mid-Autumn festival is considered as the second most important holiday in China after the Lunar New Year.
The annual festival is held on the 15th day of the 8th month on the lunar calendar.
The origins of this festival dates back to Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE) where farmers celebrate the harvest of the crops and express thanks to the Mountain Gods.
The MOONCAKE became the offering as the public worshiped the moon during every autumn’s lunar.
There are also a great number of legends and folktales associated with the origins of moon cakes which have circulated.
Another importance is the shape of the moon as well as mooncake.
Thus, the round mooncake is not only a delicacy and dessert enjoyed, but it emphasizes the special importance that Chinese people attach to family reunion.
Police is not just the principle executor of the laws but also the primary keeper of peace and order.
Its functions include enforcing the laws, enacted by the legislature as well as the decisions of the court, besides, of course, preventing crime.
Police officers have a lot of authority in society and they are very important people for enforcing the law and ensuring the safety.
Police officer is an official employee of the police force.
"Police officers help to prevent crime and disorder, and uphold the law".
A decision to become a police officer is not an easy one.
Not only because it involves a lot of risky and dangerous situations, but because it puts a great responsibility on you.
Being a police officer is not just a job, even though you have salary.
You definitely have to think hard before you take a decision.
It’s well known that many young people’s police officer’s carriers end soon after they get started.
"When young men and women begin their law enforcement careers as police officers, they have no idea just how many pitfalls lay before them. Too many new police officers listen to bad advice, and they develop bad working habits".
Moreover, to become a police officer you have to meet a number of essentially important requirements which are, for example, to be physically available for those kinds of activities that being a police force employee must perform.
All your abilities and skills are thoroughly checked, since your level of competence and the quality of your performance will probably result in human life rescuing.
If thinking about future prospects, "employment of police is expected to increase about as fast as the average for all occupations through 2020. This is because people are concerned about crime and safety".
And probably, that’s a change for the better.
The summer before my junior year in high school, my family and I took a trip to a completely new world.
Being from a small town, I had never really been exposed to the elements of a large city such as New York City.
My trip there was like discovering an entirely new way of life that I had only heard stories of previously.
For about the tenth time the morning of the flight, I checked my room to make sure I didn’t leave anything essential behind.
My stomach was doing flips as we arrived at the airport and made our way to the gate.
It didn’t get much better than this: I watched through the window as the runway zoomed by and the buildings and houses became smaller and smaller as the plane gained altitude.
An exhilarating feeling overcame me as I realized that I would soon be in one of the most amazing cities of the United States.
As we stood waiting for a taxi outside of the airport, it was immediately apparent to me that New York City was not the same as New Caney, Texas.
It seemed like everyone there was in a hurry to get to another place.
The loud and constant sound of cars honking was heard throughout the entire trip.
As soon as a car seemed to be going slower than the person behind him liked, he would hear the horn of that car to let him know that he was apparently holding everybody else up!
When we found our hotel in Times Square, I noticed that it wasn’t just the cars that were in a hurry.
Everyone in the streets was walking at a brisk pace that indicated a rush to be somewhere.
The transportation of the city was also far different than anything that I had ever been exposed to.
In my little town, a bike, a car, or even walking was perfectly suitable for getting around town, but in this foreign land, there were many more ways for one to get to another destination.
Everywhere you looked, there were people hailing taxis, waiting on buses, rushing underground to the subway stations, walking frantically, or desperately trying to maneuver their own cars through the busy streets.
Just standing and watching the many people rushing their own separate ways was an interesting observation.
In addition to the people and transportation, the buildings were also an incredible sight.
Each street was crammed with buildings that were built side by side with no room in between them, and a number of skyscrapers were present throughout the city as well.
I was awestruck again as we went inside some of these buildings such as the Empire State Building and made our way towards the top.
Standing outside of one of the top stories of the Empire State Building was awesome.
I could hold the entire city in my hand from this view.
I could even see Ellis Island a distance away from there.
The stores were also large compared to the ones of my little town.
A small retail store in New Caney would be a huge store that took up an entire building in New York.
This would make it seem logical that the prices of everything in New York were almost triple those back home.
It was as if the little peaceful neighborhood where I lived was magnified by 100 to make up the wonder city of New York.
My visit to New York City was a life changing experience.
For the first time in my life, I was exposed to a little taste of what the real world is like.
The incredible modes of transportation, the huge skyscrapers, and all of the thousands of people made me anxious to grow up and perhaps move to an incredible city such as this one.
Either way, my first trip to New York was one of the most incredible experiences of my life, one I will always treasure.
FAMILYI cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side.
Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that should never be taken for granted.
Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.
Whether it’s my grandparent, my two sisters, my mom, or my dad, I know I can always count on someone to help me feel better.
In fact, I think that this is probably the most important thing that my family has taught me;
a family is made up of people who you can trust and who you can count on.
Too many times today, we read in the papers about families where parents abuse their children, verbally and physically.
What these parents don’t realize is that they are either beginning or involving themselves in a vicious circle of hate in families.
When parents abuse their children, they are telling their children that that is the way to raise children, and this is what their children learn.
I was lucky, I have learned differently, because my family cares about me, and I care about them.
In this world of doubt, insecurity, and fear, my family is always there for me, holding their arms open to me with love.
On the first day of first grade, I didn’t want to go to school, I had butterflies in my stomach and I found it difficult to walk because I was so nervous.
The only reason that I finally went into the classroom is because my mom walked in with me, and promised me that as soon as school was out, she’d be there waiting for me, ready to bring me back to where I felt most comfortable, my family.
Luckily, I’m a little more grown up now;
I can go into school by myself, and in a couple of years, when I go away to college, I’ll really have to go to school by myself.
Of course I know I’ll make friends, but none of them will mean as much to me as my family.
It seems like every parent wants their kid to grow up to be a doctor.
but, maybe you really want to!
Being a doctor is all about helping sick people get healthy, and if this sounds like something you want to do, then find out what it takes to follow your dream!
As you know, If you have the flu, you go see the doctor.
If you break your leg from falling down the stairs, you go see the doctor.
If you get sick with something serious like mono or the measles, you go see the doctor.
As you can see, medical doctors do a lot more then wear white coats and carry around stethoscopes.
They help sick people by figuring out what’s wrong with them and giving them the right medicine to get better.
Forget Superman or Spider-Man or any of those other superheroes – doctors are the real heroes cuz they’re the ones who save people’s lives!
Nothing is more rewarding than that.
Most doctors may have to work on evenings and weekends too, and be on call.
That means you have to wear a pager 24/7 and if you get paged, you’ll have to go into work, even if it’s your birthday or a holiday, cuz a sick person needs your help.
Oh, and that’s another downside – you’re always around sick people, which can be pretty depressing.
During my visit to Da Lat last year, I quickly realised why Da Lat was often referred to as a small version of the Netherlands.
The narrow streets there were always filled with blossoming and colorful flowers.
As the locals were preparing for the Flower Festival, most of the streets were decorated with "umbrella inflorescences" made from umbrellas and a lot of bright lights.
These Umbrella inflorescences would be hung next to each other at varying heights ranging from 7 to 9 meters.
In the day time, these umbrellas looked like flowers and at night.
they glowed like splendid flower lanterns.
Both sides of the street had small vendor booths with coffee, tea, wine and street drawings for tourists to enjoy.
Everyday, people would enjoy a street parade with thousands of decorated flowers on various items.
On a vehicle, dancers would wear floral dresses and throw petals to nearby passengers.
Leisurely walking down the street while enjoying all of the colors and smells that thousands of flowers shared with me was my daily activity while I was in Da Lat.
But if you were looking for something more exciting, there were also dozens of exhibitions and trade shows full of flowers, food and drinks, all available for you to explore and enjoy.
I chose to visit the Flowers Market and Food by Flowers festival.
Food made from flowers in Da Lat was not only unique in taste but also was presented in magnificent ways.
I didn’t know that there were so many edible flowers that tasted so great.
I was amazed at how these skillful chefs were able to preserve the original scents and flavors of the flowers after cooking.
every dish looked like a little masterpiece.
Da Lat was also a perfect place for couples on their honeymoon vacation.
They could visit the flower villages in Ha Dong, Thai Phien or Van Thanh, each village would bring them an unique experience.
Ha Dong flower villages still preserved the traditional method of gardening from seedlings with natural fertilizing and harvesting.
while Thai Phien flower village looked like a small industrial zone with sparkling glass houses.
During honeymoon vacation, they could also visit the House of Love, a special flower garden in the Love Valley as well as take a trip to the Immortal Flower Hill in Lament Lake or Gold Flower Hill in Golden Valley.
The temperature in Da Lat was always around 20 degrees Celsius and the weather was often foggy.
The subtle scent of thousands of flowers created a beautiful atmosphere for honeymooners.
Colorful paintings with hundreds of blossoms throughout the area created a romantic look that was indescribable.
The Da Lat flower festival closing ceremony was situated next to Xuan Huong Lake.
There were thousands of visitors that participated in an exciting street dance with nearly 4000 liters of wine served while I was there.
The Wine festival was a feast specially designed to say good-bye to visitors traveling to Da Lat for the flower festival in this mountainous region of Vietnam.
It was an experience I would never forget.
Many years ago, when I was a little child, I admired adventures.
I think that since I breathed in for the first time and felt the ground underneath my feet, when for the very first time I looked at the night sky and its numerous eyes, I wished to live the life of an adventurer.
To explore the jungles, to stride the dessert, to wander through the lost cities and to dive into the deep darkness of the ocean I find extremely exciting.
My wish is to be an adventurer.
To be an adventurer you need some qualities.
You need to know how to get out of some risky and dangerous situations.
You need to know how to survive.
It would also be suggested to know how to sail, because a good sailor is a good adventurer.
What is more, the most epic adventures are found on the sea.
The best thing about going on an adventure is that it is really exciting, filled with thrill and danger.
And, I know it is some kind of cliche, but danger is my middle name.
Another good thing about adventure is the sights you see, the beautiful forests, and the castles.
so many wonderful castles that have numerous ancient tales about knights and dragons.
But like every human has his disadvantages, going on adventures has its bad sides too.
In all the danger and thrill, many have lost their lives.
And so ‘through the darkness and night a beam of light appears and the Dovahkiin comes,’ as the legend says.
One day, a man shall appear and repel all the evil, he will kill all the foes of his land.
But more importantly, he will win, he will conquer all the obstacles and get to his goal.
And, by following his steps, I will become an adventurer for sure.
my mother.
Do you have someone who is great, spends time with you, cares for you, and is an important person?
Well, I do!
she has black hair, brown eyes, and a caring touch.
That’s my mom.
My mom talks to me about many things.
One of the things she talks to me about is what will happen when I grow up.
She tells me what to do in case of an emergency.
And one day I had a really bad day with my friends, and she told me what to do about it.
My mom and I spend a lot of time together.
We play games, bake cookies, make necklaces, and draw doodle tricks.
But our favorite thing to do is read.
Our favorite book is "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie".
Mom takes me shopping at the mall.
We buy toys and clothes, and we eat at the café.
We usually get Chinese food or go to a McDonald’s restaurant.
When we ride the escalator, my mom pretends to fall back and says, "My shoestring’s stuck!".
My mom always laughs, and when she laughs she sounds like a hyena gone crazy!
She doesn’t laugh every day, but when she does, it’s hilarious, and I have to laugh, too!
My mom is the greatest.
I love how she jokes around.
She is always fun no matter what.
She gives me great advice.
My mom is more than a mom, she is like my best friend!
My hobby is collecting books.
I collect books whenever I have more need for some books.
I collect many kinds of books such a love story books or textbooks I am learning at school, you know, Maths, History, Geography, Biology.
and books about nature.
I buy books from a bookshop near my house, and some other stores.
I also get books from my friends.
I collect books because I would like to learn from books.
They help me broaden my knowledge.
In the future, I try to make my collection larger.

an author you always wanted-to-read, but- never-had-the-time.
a subject about which you wish to learn more — the American Indian, or the American Indian of the 19th century, or the Blackfoot Tribe or the agriculture of the Algonquins — you can collect recent in-print books, books from the 19th century, books from the first century of printing, paperback books, pulp magazines, fine leather bindings, historic newspapers, pamphlets from the period of the American Revolution or the French Revolution or Vietnam, books printed on mission presses in the Pacific, or even books about book collecting!
Book collecting is expensive!
Not true!
You can spend as little or as much as you are able and willing to spend on your collection.
Some collectors purchase only new in-print books, others buy only at yard sales and library book sales, others visit their neighborhood used book shop, others order only from mail order antiquarian book catalogs, and many are now buying books on the world wide web.
If you are very limited in discretionary funding or very frugal, you could even hold yourself to a maximum of $1.00 (US or the equivalent) per volume by buying at flea markets and yard sales and slowly build an interesting and potentially valuable collection.
Hoi An is an ancient town down the Thu Bon River, on the coastal plain of Quang Nam Province, for about 30 km south of Da Nang City.
Hoi An used to be known as the international market with many different names such as Lam Ap, Faifo, Hoai Pho and Hoi An is the most common one now.
What is special about Hoi An is that this little port town is in an incredible state of preservation.
It includes some of the most densely-concentrated sights in Viet Nam with its old streets which are bordered with ancient houses and assembly halls, its pagodas, temples, ancient wells and tombs.
In total, there are more than a thousand places of interest.
The architecture in Hoi An is characterized by a harmonious blend of Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese culture.
After many centuries, Hoi An is still respectful of its traditions, folk festivals, beliefs and of its sophisticated culinary art.
Located in a quiet environment, Hoi An is surrounded by peaceful villages famous for crafts such as carpentry, bronze making, ceramic.
Researchers said that most of the buildings in Hoi An underwent restoration at the beginning of the 19th century, even if some of them might be constructed long time ago.
The ancient architecture is shown most clearly in the Ancient Town that is located in Minh An Ward.
It covers about 2 square kilometers and almost of all famous relics in Hoi An are gathered here.
The streets are very short and narrow, having a winding, crossing as the chessboard style.
The topography of the ancient town tilt gradually from north to south.
The buildings in the old town are built mostly with traditional materials such as.
brick, wood and no more than two floors.
The trace of time is able to find not only on the architectural design of each building but also everywhere like.
on the yin-yang roof tiles covered with moss and plants.
the old gray mold walls.
the pictures carved on a strange animal, or describing an old story.
Having inherited a multi-cultural architecture which is so varied and sophisticated, Hoi An must have attracted numerous and talented workers in carpentry, ceramics, and woodcarving from China, Japan and other regions of Viet Nam.
For centuries, Hoi An had developed into a melting pot of various nationalities who came to the area, and brought along their own cultures.
Accordingly, Hoi An features the co-existence of indigenous customs and habits and those imported by foreign settlers.
Essay on my trip to Nha Trang cityMy first visit to Nha Trang, a coastal city in Vietnam, was three years ago.
It was a pleasant and memorable trip.
Nha Trang, the Capital of Khanh Hoa province, has one of the most popular municipal beaches in all of Vietnam.
In Nha Trang, nature beauties are so attractive.
Waves crashing onto the cliffs.
the soft sigh of the sea breeze.
clean white sands and turquoise waters.
it all makes for a marvelous landscapes.
It’s no accident that Nha Trang is often compared to a Mediterranean City.
During my visit to Nha Trang, I used to get up early each morning to stroll along the beach – a chance of breathing in the fresh sea air and enjoy the sunrise across the water.
One attraction that captivated me three years ago and still it does is the collection of small offshore islands.
Hon Tre is the largest among the islands, and Monkey island is, as the name suggests, the home of hundreds of wild monkeys.
Yen island is known for its swifts’ nests.
Tri Nguyen island is the location of an outdoor aquarium housing more than 400 species of fish, crustaceans and other marine life.
That trip, I spent the whole day roaming the Ponaga Cham towers.
These ancient Hindu temples were built from the 7th to 12th century.
Many of the sandstone statues from this time still remain among the red brick towers, typical of Cham architecture.
Nha Trang is the city in harmony.
its fine weather, favorite position and friendly people bring it a certain balance.
Nha Trang is a perfect tourist destination.
As I left, I was reminded of one reason I like the place so much.
I hope to have chance to come back.
I love listening to music, but I am not like other people who often listen to the music that is popular at a time.
The part of music that attracts me is the attitude of the composers and the tone, because the songs represent the writers’ mood and feeling.
Through the songs people can feel what the composers try to express, so I often listen to Jazz, Rock, and R&B.
These three types of music contain different languages but they are all my favorite music styles.
When I really want to relax my body, or to do the exercises at home I will listen to Jazz music.
I do not have the exact time to do exercises, I just play it to release my body.
Jazz music is much faster and more relaxing than pop music.
It makes me want to dance, to do any kind of motion to let go of my body while the music is on.
Sometimes I prefer to do it on my bed.
It is healthy for my body.
My second favorite music style is Rock, which I listen to when I am in a bad mood or lonely.
Rock is very different from Jazz because Rock is quite noisy and contains a lot of screaming.
But the tone of the songs is like magic that can flush all my unhappiness, even though those things are still right there, but at the moment I can feel I have strength to solve problems, and I am not scared of anything anymore.
When I have something to face or have to make a choice, I always listen to Rock music, let the music go through my mind so that I can think deeper and deeper.
I often just sit on the chair and do nothing.
This happened when I am quite tired or sleepy.
for example, sitting on the MRT or buses, I do not think or do anything.
I do not like to be disturbed by others, I want to have my own space.
And R&B music can help me get away from my busy life and clean up my soul.
The three types of music have different functions for me, however, they all bring me happiness and help me get through difficult time.
Hobby is the favourite work or choice which borns spontaneously from inside of a person.
It is very natural and unbiased from external influence.
It attracts us with such an intensity as weleave other more important tasks.
It make us obsessive to become besotted towards our hobby.
Hobby is that which provide peace, happiness and ultimate satisfaction in our life.
Hobbyists should be careful to do their hobby related work in their leisure time only.
Otherwise it would be a murderous to darken one’s fate.
Therefore my suggestion is thatone must be able to judge the value of time in various phases of life.
It has been noticed that a student destroyed his carrier by devoting fully on his hobby of Guitar playing.
Our like and dislike don’treflect our strength or weakness.
There must be a fine balance between our lifestyle and performance.
Music listening is my hobby.
Music is a common name that has encapsulated various kind of songs e.g.
patriotic song, religious, classical music.
The list is endless.
My mother says, when I was at the age of seven years, I was more interested to listen songs.
Also I showed reflection of singing ability in those days.
Still at this age it fits to my nature.
I love to listen songs because I feel a sense of accomplishment.
I can isolate myself from the crowd and I can pass my time with full entertainment.
It gives me new energy.
It reduces my stresses.
While listening music, I feel out of world.
I seldom hesitate to spend for my hobby.
In past time it was a dream to have a good quality music system for me.
On that time l prmished myself to buy a costly music system when I would get money.
Almighty listened my wish and now I am blessed with such a level of earning that I can buy any music system to quench thirst of my hobby.
Before Tet, people should return all the things that they have borrowed from others and pay all the debts they owed.
It is believed that people should never start a new year with debts and borrowed things.
otherwise in that year people would be stuck with debts.
On the first day of Tet, adults (those who have already got married and have income) are supposed to prepare some "lucky money" to give the children and kids when visiting other’s homes as a symbol of luck for the coming New Year.
People are also supposed to say best wishes to others.
These activities are done with the expectation that luck and good things are brought to everyone.
Gift-exchanging is another common custom during Tet holiday, which is used mostly in business.
The process of giving and receiving gifts help to enhance the relationships between clients and firms.
The popular presents are cookies, chocolates, fruit baskets, wine, soft drinks or other kinds of treats.
Usually, people can buy a pack of gifts in the shops which includes many different kinds of food.
If you have a Vietnamese business partner, take this opportunity to enhance the relationships.
Tet is a special occasion that people wear new and beautiful outfits.
The streets during Tet is full with colorful dresses, ao dai and other costumes.
It is thought that colorful bright colors like red, yellow or blue can bring good luck and prosperity to people for the upcoming year.
Another essential element of Tet is smiles.
A smile can make everything seem more relaxing and enhance relationship among people.
A smile can bring joy and happiness to you as well as people around you for the whole year also.
During this Tet, people refrain themselves from getting angry or depressed and put an instant smile on their faces, hoping for a happy new year.
Technology is now a big part of our society and our predictable future.
There is little room for people who wish to live without technology, and luckily, it is still advancing at a rate that has helped stave off stagnation.
I believe that for every advantage that technology brings us, it also brings us a disadvantage at the same time.
Smartphones enable people to stay in touch, even over long distances, and they are relatively safe and reliable to use.
There are devices that people can use to communicate with plus at the other end of the planet and getting and keeping in touch with other people is very easy.
The disadvantages of smartphone is that it means people no longer need to meet in person as much, and interpersonal relationships are suffering worldwide because people are communicating through a small handheld device.
A lot of people have smartphones and they use them almost semi-continuously, including in public settings when they could be making new friends, finding new lovers, and interacting with their current friends.
The advantages of the internet are that people can communicate over vast distances and can gain access to information and get answers to their questions very quickly.
The disadvantage is that the Internet isn’t moderated in the way that people think and lots of it is filled with misinformation and outright lies.
Even brand-named websites which have a lot of trust are not accountable for what appears on their own websites.
Even respected and branded news sites have stories that have passed through many people’s hands and originally started as lies with zero accountability throughout the dissemination process.
In conclusion, technology brings about such a lot of advantages.
However, it’s people’s duty to use it in an appropriate way to make it beneficial.
The job that I have is also the same as the job that I have always wanted to have.
I’m an English teacher, and I also run a website called DailyStep.
com, so that I can teach English to many more people than I could teach in one classroom.
Different aspects of my job involve different skills.
When it comes to teaching, the job involves, of course, teaching students for general and business English, and so on.
This requires a detailed knowledge of grammar, syntax, business skills such as presentations and meetings and more.
The website side involves other skills, many of which I have had to acquire as I went along.
I have to write dialogues for lessons, produce blogs, answer emails, record audio files, maintain the content on the website, and liaise with technical developers on website improvements I have suggested.
Of course, I also have to deal with day to day problems as they arise.
I chose the job of English teacher after several years working as a researcher and journalist, as English is my first love and my passion.
I really enjoy explaining things in a concise and clear way too.
When I was a child, I used to like games such as organizing words into categories, and I think perhaps the kick I get from explaining grammar well is an extension of that.
I’m interested in this job for so many reasons.
As I mentioned, I love the English language.
I am also fascinated to learn about people and their life stories, and in this job I meet a huge variety of people from all over the world.
I’m keen to help bridge the divides between cultures.
when people speak a common language, and can communicate, then perhaps they can start to understand each other better in other ways too.

In the future I want to become a fashion designer.
My goal is to create clothes for all sizes, ages, and genders.
In my clothing I want to show a creative side of my artistic ability and I want to make my clothing affordable for all as well.
I think I want to become a fashion designer because I have a passion for art.
I enjoy making sketches of clothing that I hope one day will be available in stores all over the world.
Fashion designing, to me, is a way to express the unique side of your creativity.
This is also a career that I believe I can achieve if I stay focused and continue to put effort in my creations.
I find interior designing as a possible career in my future since it’s somewhat similar to fashion designing.
Both involve having a sense of style and an eye for color, texture and pattern coordination.
In order to prepare for this career in my future I need to attend a college involving designing, fashion designing, and a type of art.
The qualification I would need would be a two to four-year college for fashion designing and a one to three-year college for interior designing.
These careers require a bachelor’s degree in some place of art.
So as to attend college, first of all I have to maintain an acceptable grade point average which is 2.5 or higher depending on the location of the college as well as the level of the skill learning of the college.
It is undoubtedly the case that cities around the world increasingly suffer from congestion.
In this essay, I will examine the reasons leading to this trend and suggest some practical policies the authorities could implement to reduce the level of traffic in our cities.
The first step is to understand why traffic has increased in cities.
Broadly speaking, there are three main reasons for this.
The third reason is that society has in general become more mobile and this means more people are prepared to commute to work by car than they were before.
There is almost certainly no one who can propose solution to this problem given the complexity of its causes.
However, one option has to be to improve the reliability of public transport to encourage people to take buses or the trains rather than get in their cars.
It would also be possible to discourage people from driving to work by introducing special tariffs for using the roads, especially during rush hours.
A successful example of this is the congestion charge scheme in London which has certainly reduced the level of traffic in inner-city areas.
In conclusion, there are a variety of different factors that have led to rising levels of traffic in urban areas.
While it may not be possible to find a complete solution, any action should probably involve encouraging greater use of public transport and making it more expensive for the motorist to drive in urban areas.
The job of a pilot is a very hard and risky, but prestigious one.
Pilots travel thousands of kilometers a day and they can find themselves in different time and climate zone.
They can see all parts of the world and get to know new people where they arrive.
But a pilot also faces some problems.
They often suffer from jet lag and can easily become tired when being in different time zones.
They have to spend many days away from home and their families.
Even though many people think it is a real dream job, pilots must be responsible for other people because they hold the lives of a few hundred passengers in their hands.
They are required to have hundreds of hours of training before that.
Pilots must remain calm in dangerous situations and always have to make the right decisions.
They also need to see and hear perfectly.
Many people believe that pilots are paid a lot of money.
It is true for pilots who work for a big airline company, smaller budget ones cannot afford to pay their pilots that much.
In today’s world, airlines are competing fiercely for their market shares.
As a result, pilots may lose their jobs if airlines decide to cut costs.
Sharing is a good way of living in modern society.
Sharing, literally, means showing concerns and empathy towards other people.
.
The sharing is expressed in many ways, which can be very small actions such as encouragement, comforting words, holding hands or loving eyes.
sharing has a very important role in life.
No one lives without the sharing of others.
Life is always full of difficulties and no one knows what to expect.
Sometimes, we need to share so that we can get motivation to move on.
The sharing is not a figurative thing.
Sometimes, just a small action is enough.
Sharing is not difficult, all it needs is an act from the bottom of your heart.
What will you get in return for you share?
The answer is love.
If you want to receive, firstly, you have to learn how to give and to share.
Life not only has material value but also needs sincere feelings.
sharing and empathy will bring you wonderful things and make your life better.
People often say "the coldest place is not the North Pole, but the place where there is no love." Life is giving and receiving.
So, why not give love to receive love back?
In my freetime, I like to dance.
I know that for some people dancing is not considered a true hobby.
but the way I see it, if I enjoy dancing and spend my precious time doing it, then I have every right to consider it as my special hobby.
Dancing was just my thing.
As far as I can remember about my childhood, right after I learned to walk, I have always loved to dance and I began to dance around the house all the time.
My mom put me in dance school when I was three years old.
I would learn so quickly that the instructor would sometimes ask me to help her teach the other students.
My first dance show was at school festival when I was five years old.
Becoming a famous dancer was one of my greatest childhood dreams.
It is hard to define the actual start of dancing.
Dancing has been around for too long that people can’t remember.
Dancing is a category of art that is popular worldwide, streaming through every country in many forms.
Everyone can dance in their own way so it is easy to get started with this hobby.
Dancing requires both physical and mental tenacity.
This is difficult in the face of a highly competitive atmosphere and the pressures of a busy academic and social life.
However, my passion and love for it have made all of these struggles worth it.
Dancing was a hobby that I always will love.
My love of dance has always served as an inspiration for me.
I dance from my heart and always strive to do my best.
My father is a lovely father of the world.
He is my real hero, my best friend, my inspiration in my life.
He is the person who helps me a lot in getting prepared for the school, getting rise of the bed and having my homework done well.
He always cares for me and calls my mom in the afternoon just to know that whether I arrive home from school at right time or not.
He is very healthy, fit, happy, peaceful and punctual person.
He always goes to the office on time and also teaches us to go to school at right time.
He teaches us the value of time in life and says that if one wastes his/her time, time ruins his/her life.
He is a very nice person and helps my neighbors in their difficult time.
He always loves, cares and respects my mom and never quarrels with her.
He always supports her and sometimes, he helps in the kitchen during her illness.
He respects and loves my grandparents and teaches us to take care of them.
He tells us that old people are like God for us, we should care, love and respect them.
We should never avoid the old in their difficult time as this time comes in everyone’s life once.
He tells us that we should always help needy people of any age group all through the life according to our status.
He takes 15 minutes of us every day to tell us about the ethics and other good habits.
Every teacher devotes all his or her life to education.
It usually isn’t because of the money or the three-month summer vacation.
Reasons for becoming a teacher are deeper than that, and while they are personal, they are almost all united by the desire to impact peoples’ lives.
One reason to become a teacher is to influence the education system.
If you recognize the need to improve the quality of education in your country, then you may become a teacher to make change.
There is a lot of work to be done, but it is the collective effort of thousands of dedicated teachers that will make the most difference.
Another reason for becoming a teacher is to make contribution to your community in a meaningful way.
Teaching is one of the most direct ways to make an impact, and if you are driven by the desire to help people around you, being a teacher is an invaluable contribution.
Teachers do more than teaching, and their impact extends far beyond the classroom.
As a teacher, you are more than just an educator because you are a mentor, a confidant and a friend.
One of the most common reasons to become a teacher is to make a difference in the lives of as many students as possible.
Teachers have more chances to interact with students at all stages of development and from all walks of life.
A great teacher always wants to help students along their path and to play a part in shaping the person they hope to become.
Becoming a teacher lets you impart life lessons that they will never forget and puts you in a position to influence their decisions, behaviors, strengths, weaknesses and imaginations.
Essentially, becoming a teacher lets you take part in shaping the next generation.
What’s your hobby?
Reading books, listening to music, shopping.
or feeding cats like me.
The biggest hobby I like is feeding cats.
I guess that many people will have this hobby like me, especially girls.
Cats are dutiful, cute and very easy to feed.
Since I was 10, I have been interested in having a cat, and my father gave me a white cat as a gift to celebrate the 11th birthday.
I cried so much, because of happiness, and I promised that I will take care of him carefully.
And now, I’m 18 years old, I still raise this cat.
Every day in the morning, I usually feed him, and then I go to school, and he stays at home.
In the afternoon, I take him for a walk with my mother.
About 2 – 3 days, I just take him to have a bath, because, he is scared of water.
In the winter, I really like to buy clothing for my cat to make him warm, and this is the best thing I like.
Next time, I prepare to have a lady cat from my grandma, so I feel happy and look forward to this moment.
And you, do you love cats like me?
Mountains always have a great fascination for men and people, particularly the rich go to the mountains to escape from the noise of the life below.
Mountain climbing, however, is not without risks.
It is a challenge to the unconquerable spirit of a man and his love of adventure.
That this is a dangerous sport cannot be denied.
When one climbs higher and higher, breathing becomes more and more difficult.
Some climbers, therefore, carry a heavy apparatus on their back from which they inhale oxygen.
Mountain climbing is extremely dangerous.
There are snow storms and blizzards.
It is troublesome to walk through the snow.
It is still more difficult to climb on ice because it is hard to keep foothold and cut steps with axes so as to make progress.
The cold is so severe that the climber’s feet, toes and fingers may suffer from frostbite.
The most serious difficulty is that the climber at a high altitude gets exhausted with a little effort.
Mountain climbing requires proper training, skill and knowledge.
The climbers must be well equipped.
They must be in good physical condition and should have courage, perseverance and power of endurance.
They should carry with them maps, compasses and other equipment in order that they are able to find out where they are in the absence of any, tracks.
The climbers take with them packs loaded with first-aid supplies, food and extra clothing for sudden changes of weather.
They display the spirit of sportsmanship and fellow-feeling and face the severe risks of life undaunted.
Mountain climbing is a thrilling but manly adventure.
It brings into playing the heroic qualities of man.
Mountaineers deserve all praise for their courage and heroism.
Ho Chi Minh City is one of the biggest cities in the south of Vietnam, which provides people with a great number of various jobs.
Therefore, people from many different parts of the country keep on moving to this city, hoping to find out their ‘paradise’.
For those who have been living in this city for a long time, more than 10 years for example, their ‘used-to-be paradise’ is getting worse and worse.
Its increasing crime and disorder also makes Ho Chi Minh City a worse place to live in today than ten years ago.
A number of the city dwellers, especially young illiterate guys of lower social classes, cannot earn their living legally.
They allow themselves to rob or steal anything they can to satisfy their needs, irrespective of how serious the consequences of their frightening acts are.
Pollution is the first thing that makes Ho chi Minh City a worse place to live in.
Its drainage system has been overbooked to drain for a city of over seven million people nowadays.
Consequently, the so-called ‘the pearl of the Far East’ is getting more and more polluted.
Water pollution is only part of the pollution facing all the dwellers of this biggest city in Vietnam.
The air pollution here is no less serious.
Thousands of factories are still located inside this city and keep on releasing poisonous smoke.
Various means of transportation, especially millions of motorcycles, do contribute to the ever-increasing air pollution in Ho Chi Minh city.
It is invariably true that every person who is knowledgeable leads a successful life.
Knowledge is very important tool to get positive changes in the society and country.
Knowledge helps us to absorb things from the genius people which have potential to improve the quality of life.
Knowledge is the only precious thing which nobody can take away from us.
It gives new and revolutionary ideas which help to alter the way of viewing the world.
So, we can say that knowledge is pillar to the success and happiness.
Knowledge helps us to convert our planning into the right action and enables to get the difference between right or wrong and good or bad.
It helps us to overcome our weaknesses and faults as well as makes us able to face the dangers and difficulties by giving lots of courage and confidence.
It makes a person more powerful by giving him mental, moral and spiritual advancement in the life.
Human beings are physically weaker than animals yet they have managed things for years to become the most powerful creature on earth.
Because they get power from knowledge and are independent on the physical strength.
Human beings are clever creature of nature, they have ability to acquire knowledge and preserve their knowledge, research and experiences in the books in order to pass to the new generations.
Knowledge gives them power to know how to control the forces of nature and then use them for getting benefited.
Knowledge is a most strong tool which cannot be defeated by other power on the earth.
Knowledge provides social power to person holding certain power over those people who do not.
Obtaining knowledge helps to address various difficulties in life.
Cats as pets have become far more familiar with mankind community, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations.
However, although problems regarding cats’ hair may affect the health conditions of people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally, are clearly undeniable.
In term of physical benefits, the well-being with cats are more favorable compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take after themselves, the responsibility to ensure their love one being fed and well taken care of makes them to become even more active.
Owing to these extra activities, this though might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad lifestyles.
Coupled with physical side, their mental aspect will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the feeling of loneliness.
Therefore, their depressing rate could be minimized.
Despite the above advantages, the threats of too close interaction between cats and vulnerable people still exist.
One of the major concerns is the harmfulness of their hairs on their owner, especially those with asthma.
Because of the virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets.
In addition, old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, because their health conditions are limited, which could become even more challenging when they try to take care of others.
In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic outweigh its shortages.
For these reasons, instead of discontinuing them, further support would be far more beneficial.
Nowadays, teamwork is an essential element of the society.
We all work with people everyday.
A co-worker is a person with whom we work closely and share tasks.
In my opinion, the important characteristics of a co-worker should be as followed.
First of all, an important character of a co-worker should be reliability.
As we often have to encounter a lot of problems at work, it is a good thing to work with someone that we can always count on.
A reliable co-worker can help us with problems that we cannot solve by ourselves.
Also, if we happen to be absent from work, a reliable co-worker can always backup what we have been working on and make correct decisions even without us.
Last of all, another important character of a co-worker should be responsibility.
Indeed, no one would want an irresponsible person as his or her co-worker.
It would be a nightmare if your co-worker does not do anything and leave everything for you to finish.
On the other hand, a responsible co-worker not only do his own part of work, but also, as soon he finishes his own, helps you finish yours, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the work.
A responsible co-worker can help others work more efficiently by giving others aid in addition to getting their part of job done.
To summarize, as I have stated above, a good co-worker should be reliable and responsible.
A co-worker that possesses these characteristics can certainly help enhance the progress of work and benefits his or her colleagues as well.
Violin is one of the rare instruments that you can learn at a very young age, as they make very small student versions, and so at the age of 10 I began to learn to play violin.
Learning violin was a lot of fun to me due to the great teachers in the class, and now that my parents knew that I needed to stay interested so as to keep progressing.
Following the traditional path, I started with group violin lessons rather than individual violin lessons.
I didn’t even start with a real violin.
we all had boxes that were wrapped in brown paper!
A ruler was taped to the end of the box to simulate a fingerboard, and our "bow" was the cardboard tube from a clothes hanger.
Therefore, my very first lessons on how to play violin were actually about how to stand, how to hold the violin, and how to make the proper movements in unison with the teacher and the other kids.
It didn’t take long for me to earn the privilege of unwrapping my box and receiving a real violin.
And soon my violin lessons, along with daily practice with my parents, became part of the family routine.
I know now that to learn to play violin, you need to be drawn to the sound of the violin.
You’re going to be hearing that sound a lot, so it’s very crucial to have some connection there from the start!
You will need someone who can show you proper setup at the beginning, since there are so many dead ends and blind alleys related to postures and positioning that are very hard to overcome without help.
And you also need someone around you who can motivate you and keep you accountable on a regular basis.
It’s best if this person is a violin teacher, someone who can assess your progress regularly.
Why learn to play violin instead of other instruments?
Because the violin is so versatile!
You can play alone, choosing among hundreds of years’ worth of solo repertoire from composers as diverse as Bach, Paganini, Bartok or John Adams.
You can play with a friend who has a piano, or with three in a string quartet.
You can also play in a string orchestra or a full orchestra.
And there are many more community orchestras than professional ones so that anybody that wants to play in a group has a chance.
The discipline and love of the violin sound will take you anywhere you want to go.
If you’ve been thinking about learning to play violin, don’t wait any longer!
Find a violin, get it a check-up, and get someone to show you the basis.
Then don’t let anything stand in your way.
Because of the deep penetration of the Internet across the world, it would indeed be a big problem if the ‘Internet plug’ was pulled out from our lives.
We have become dependent on the Internet for most of the things we want to do such as learning, shopping, socializing, or entertaining ourselves.
It has become a way of life for many of us.
In the absence of the Internet, the implications would be devastating.
The impact of having no Internet on your overall living style would depend upon how often you use it, and what you use it for.
If you were an Internet addict, you would find that your life has come to a screeching halt.
People use the Internet to stay connected to our friends and family.
If you had gotten very used to socializing online, you would now be clueless as to how you could share those pictures of your recent trip you went for, with your friends spread across the globe.
It would be difficult to meet and interact with people living outside your locality.
With no way to communicate using emails, instant messaging, chat, or social media, we would have to resort to those old ways of communicating with people.
We would have to resort to the option of a face-to-face interaction, telephone conversation, or sending and receiving snail mail.
The Internet has become a gigantic sea of information and resources.
No Internet would mean no instant and easy access to information at the click of a button.
You would have to walk down to your local library and actually search the whole place to get the information you are looking for, with little chances that you will find what you seek instantly.
Students who were in the habit of using the Internet for completing their assignments and projects will have a tough time figuring out an alternative.
To sum up, the Internet now plays an important role in our daily life.
If there were no its existence, you couldn’t read this example essay.
Playing sport is necessary because it brings about physical strength and mental power to the person involved in this on regular basis.
Outdoor sports such as football, cricket, volleyball, hockey, running, help in improving physical health and mental fitness.
However, some indoor games and sports like brain games, chess, Sudoku.
improve mental power and concentration level.
Sports and games are very beneficial to us as they teach us punctuality, patient, discipline, teamwork and dedication.
Being involved in the sports activities helps us in getting protected with numerous diseases such as arthritis, obesity, heart problems, diabetes.
It teaches us to go ahead in life by removing all the weaknesses.
It makes us bold and gives the feeling of happiness by reducing the occurrence of anxiety and angry.
My favourite subject in high school is English.
I not only want to become fluent in foreign language but also desire to deeply understand the beauty of this language.
In my opinion, English is one of the most powerful tools that exists nowadays to communicate to other people.
It makes easier to make friends around the world.
By using english, we can explore the world in a deeper way.
Thanks to this language, I can understand more about different cultures.
I am the kind of person who love traveling.
Therefore, it’s essential to master in English if you want to communicate to the local people.
In addition, you won’t feel lost in the middle of a city because you can ask the natives for help.
It was such an amazing method of communication when I travelled in Japan, French or Korea without knowing the local languages.
Furthermore, I believe that English helps a lot to get access to the latest information about scientific topics such as Economics, which by the way was my major at university.
If you want to be at the forefront in your professional field, nothing is better than reading the different articles.
Whilst, most of them are written in English.
In conclusion, I think that there are many reasons to learn English because of it’s benefits.
If you really fall in love with English, you will never want to give up it for any reasons.
Everyone always has expectation to be rich or to have his or her own company.
Some people dream of becoming leaders, politicians and famous stars.
There are others who are interested in becoming poets, writers and novelists while most of us generally have a desire of becoming engineers, doctors and scientists of great repute.
It is not easy to choose a career that is suitable or relevant to your major today.
Hundreds of students are leaving schools and universities every year to seek employment in the various professions, though employment opportunities are not increasing proportionately.
As a result, the rate of unemployment is increasing rapidly every year.
Before graduating from school or university, you may have many plans and be confident that choosing a career will not be difficult.
However, after graduation, you will find that there are others with better qualifications waiting to enter the same position.
It means that the job which you are willing to follow, could be taken by others.
In reality, many employees are working in the fields that are not actually relevant to his or her major in schools.
In conclusion, I believe that the dream of becoming a mill-owner or a multi­millionaire can become true or turn out to be nothing.
However, following a career sometimes is just a life of simplicity and goodness devoted to the service of humanity.
Before any decisions to career, you should remember that.
the motto of this life is ‘simple living and high satisfaction.
Sport is a very important thing in our life.
It plays a vital role in keeping our health safe as well as contributing in human personality.
Some of these sports are dangerous like high-speed motor racing.
Many people prefer this dangerous sports and keep practicing regularly.
There are several reasons why many people like motor racing.
The large amount of income and an astonishing fame allowing them to become a global celebrity are some of the main reasons which in turn lead to adrenalin rush among the sport professionals to participate in unsafe sporting activities.
The racing drives are those who daily undergo such high risk conditions, for instance, however, they are willing to do it repeatedly due to the rewards they receive through this.
I think they love to do so because they may feel a sort of lack of confidence, so they try to maintain this point by doing these dangerous sports.
The most striking feature, in my opinion, is the stress in addition to the negative energy that many people have, they need to get rid of their stress by practicing racing.
I tend to see that, these racers should be trained well by professional coaches before they start playing motor racing to minimize any danger that may occur during this practice.
Also, some restrictions should be done for this sport and it should be related to age, as the small children and young ages should be prevented from practicing this kind of sports because they may still young to deal with their dangerous.
Today if there is any institution which has the greatest influence on us after the family, it is the school.
The time that we spend in school are not only time spent in learning and filling our minds with knowledge, but also time spent forming our character, acquiring various attitudes and imbibing basic principles of life.
The basic traits of our personality are formed during our school days.
The name of my school is Nguyen Binh Khiem High School.
It is situated in the suburb of Hai Phong city.
It is considered to be one of the finest schools in the city, highly acclaimed for its excellent for number of talented students.
The school building is an impressive structure.
It consists of four three – floor blocks and has about 36 classrooms.
Classrooms are spacious and airy.
Two staircases at both ends lead to the floors.
The school has a well-equipped library, a well- established science laboratory and two excellent computer room, all of which are situated on the a separate block.
There is an area for learning physical education and sports.
Two cemented basketball courts stand in the right corner, while the school’s football field is in the center of the area.
On the left center, there are two courts for badminton and volleyball.
A small garden full of flower plants surrounds the school building adding to the charm and beauty of the entire complex.
My school has over 1200 students.
Our headmaster is an experienced and efficient person who has been at his job for the last 10 years and more.
Under his able direction, the school has been obtaining many good result and gain the dispute in the city.
The teachers here are well-experienced and knowledgeable in their subjects.
A lot of emphasis are given to character formation, moral education and acquiring good values of life.
Although the school environment is rather strict and time-table based, but there is lot of fun and joy in the school.
Matches, tournaments, musical shows, competitions, events, make my school life lively, interesting and enjoyable.
I am proud to be a student of Nguyen Binh Khiem High school.
People tend to believe that they can only achieve happiness in life by following their "dreams", doing things they really love to do and ignoring any other factors.
In fact, happiness is not something you can measure and evaluate.
Happiness is fluid, flexible and it differs from people to people.
Happiness is unlike a goal which has concrete meaning and limit.
A goal you set can be clearly seen by other people.
However, happiness is something only you can define byyourself.
It is not a goal to achieve, rather it is a feeling you have.
The fluffy and little pleasure you have in your life is what make you happy.
A dream, in the other hand, is more complex and goal-like.
You dream to be a successful business man or a celebrity singer.
You have goals which are long-term and enormous.
However, in most cases, you just dream to be someone else rather than being that person in reality.
This is what we call fantasy dream.
To put it simple, that is an illusion you create to escape from your boring and depressing daily routine.
It has relationwith having the happiness you really want.
The happiness you need is always around you, in your own boring life.
Asking yourself this question to discover your true happiness in life.
what make you feel content, pleasant and thankful.
People blame for their own jobs, hate their devastated state of life they have, but normally forget the small grateful, and serene moments that calm their fluctuating heart.
Remember your favorite songs you repeatedly listen to.
Remember the warm and cozy dinner your mom has made for you after a long, busy day at work.
They can be just small, trivia things in your life but they surely serve you well.
What you are waiting for not in the illusion of becoming someone else, but enjoying your life to its utmost.
My long-term objective is to start up an English Centre by 2020, which will be the first one in Vietnam targeting at Economics students.
The centre, following a four-level structure, will aim at cultivating integrated English skills for learners to facilitate their academic study and research at universities, inspiring them to learn English with endeavour and renovate their own self-studying methods.
Furthermore, learners will also benefit from practical internship opportunities at the centre, as active students will be selected for short-term non-profit training programs and directly involved in organizing quarterly English events under mentors’ guidance.
Through gaining first-hand experience in particular projects, they will also actively boost their pool of soft skills, a key criterion in the recruitment policies of both multinational and domestic enterprises nowadays.
Human beings are designed in such a way that they are in constant need of love, care as well as affection during all times in their lives.
This is the reason why we seek for companionship at each and every point in our life.
We make friends and maintain a closely knit relationship with them because friends not only take away the feeling of void from your life.
they also make us feel secure and accompanied as an individual.
Friendship is considered to be a true blessing for everyone and a person with good friends will have a support system for sharing each and every moment of their life whether it is happy or sad.
I have seen friendships going on for several years and sometimes even for a lifetime with people constantly taking care of each other and maintaining a bond based on trust and care.
Especially for people living away from their homes, friends are nothing short of their family.
Often known as "siblings from different mothers," friends keep us grounded as well as also help us retain the child in us no matter how old we get or how busy we are in leading our professional as well as personal lives.
They are the ones you can run up to in times of any crisis as well as during the happy moments of your life.
Friends are our secret keepers with whom we can share everything without the fear of being judged.
The world might go through a tremendous change but friends are the people we can rely on no matter what.
At times, we may come across situations where we doubt our decisions as well as capabilities.
In situations like these, friends help us by providing us with a reality check.
They never let us down and stand besides us like a rock.
True friends show faith in us and also make us believe in our capabilities keeping aside all negative feelings of jealousy, agony and hatred.
Friends simply do not care if the fault is yours or not, they will stand by you during all times.
They will never stop defending you or putting their trust in you.
They could have seen us in the ugliest of situations and appearances and they simply do not care about these things and still decide to stick by us through every thick and thin.
In conclusion, it can be depressing for each one of us to live alone at times.
In such times, friends become our ultimate support system and they are our cure for loneliness and depression.
Always keeping each others’ back, friends are everything that we need for making our lives beautiful and content.
What makes a creative leader?
Creativity, as an intangible quality, is difficult to describe in fundamental terms.
Likewise, leadership is another virtue that cannot be easily qualified as the impacts of true leadership are far-ranging and difficult to measure.
Couple these two qualities together and what you get is an exceptionally abstract concept that becomes even more challenging to qualify.
Leaders help themselves and others to do the right things.
They set direction, build an inspiring vision, and create something new.
The ability to come up with new ideas is a defining characteristic of creative leaders.
They’re able to step out of the common view and imagine new possibilities that set the course for others to follow.
Creative Leaders anticipate failure.
They eliminate fear of failure to encourage more innovative ideas.
They are not perfectionists who never get it wrong or, worse still.
They are also not the conservatives who never take a risk.
Leadership is a mindset in action.
So don’t wait for the title.
Leadership isn’t something that anyone can give you—you have to earn it and claim it for yourself.
Each of us has a tremendous capacity for becoming a creative leader as we are unique.
Volunteer is one of Vietnam’s long-standing activities contributing effectively to community development, capacity building and poverty reduction.
Volunteer activities are taking place vibrantly with every passing day, not only do they bring positive results from specific volunteer programs but they also conduce to generate and raise awareness for a large number of people in Vietnam.
The key point of volunteer activities is a part of a global effort to ensure that every child has access to a quality education – it’s a direct route out of poverty.
In addition, the activities will be the main distributor of connecting the people, improving the living standard, and helping the poor around countries.
However, the volunteer activities of Vietnam are very diverse in both content and form.
In fact, these volunteer activities remain separate and spontaneous.
information on volunteer activities is not accessible with majority seeking information about specific volunteer programs that interest them due to the lack of coordinating network among volunteer clubs and organizations.
With a tradition of solidarity and compassion, all Vietnamese people profoundly understand that, to rise from a low starting point, each individual has to make every effort to promote internal strength by volunteering to help the needy and contribute to the development of communities and country.
Water shortage is a big concern for many countries around the world.
Drinking water protection is the responsibility of both individuals and governments.
Everyone plays key role in trying to protect the supply of water.
Water is a vital necessity that all people need in order to survive.
Without water, people could only live a few days before having serious health problems or even death.
Many people believe that the use of water should be restricted in some way.
There can be no doubt that there is a limited supply of fresh water, although some parts of the world feel this more acutely than others.
The high rate of populations around the world where fresh water is already severely scarce might lead governments to the firm decision that they should impose restrictions on how water should be used and how much of it each person should be permitted to use.
Whilst I can see that this resolution from government has a certain logic, I think that strict controls are not the final answer.
This severe problem need to be resolved by different ways.
This can be done by building more desalination plants.
However, this is very expensive and some countries could not afford to do this.
Another possibility is to educate people how to use the source of fresh water properly.
Another solution is to protect existing water supplies like underground supplies and take steps to prevent them becoming polluted.
Also, recycled water could be used for irrigating farms.
In conclusion, I believe that governments should ensure that all citizens have sufficient access to fresh water and price it – or allow it to be priced – according to supply and demand.
Besides, all citizens should have full responsibility of protecting the supply of fresh water.
Nowadays, large cities are becoming more and more inhabited because of the tendency of the immigration to the city.
Even though, it brings about many advantages such as more opportunities of jobs and higher living standard, the urban lifestyle make rural dwellers opt to live a different lifestyle than before.
Living in a big city may result in many drawbacks as discussed following.
Urban centers are filled with motorized transport and other sources of pollutants like waste from the large populations of people, or emissions from factories.
The urban centers have very few or even totally missing green spaces with higher amount of pollutants that are so harmful for citizens.
For a long time, lung cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and asthma are just a few diseases common among urban dwellers.
Another disadvantage of living in a city is traffic congestion.
Every day, many people have to struggle with the transportation jams, who usually face with being late in their office.
They are always stuck for many hours on the way to work.
In addition, more transports on the street are the main distributor of air pollution which can lead to many bad effects on man’s health.
It is undeniable that the cost of living in big cities is much higher than in countryside.
The impact of this can result in the expensive cost of the public services such as health service, postal service, education.
It will be difficult for the poor and workers to live in big cities with a low minimum wage.
They seem to struggle with the rapid changes in the price of basic necessities and public services like hospitals, schools.
Ao Dai the a traditional dress of Vietnam.
It is one of the symbols of Vietnam.
When one hears about Vietnam, the word "Ao Dai" will most probably be mentioned.
Early versions of the "Ao Dai" date back to 1744 when Lord Vu Vuong of the Nguyen Dynasty decided both men and women should wear an outfit of pants and a gown that buttoned down the front.
What wasn’t, until 1930 that "Ao Dai"appear similar to what it looks today.
Now, Men wear it less, generally only on ceremonial occasions such as weddings or funerals.
During the 1950s two tailors in Saigon started producing "Ao Dai" with raglan sleeves.
This creates a diagonal seam running from the collar to the underarm.
This style is still preferred today"Ao Dai" is made individually to fit each customer’s shape to create the most flattering look.
Its body-hugging top flows over wide trousers that brush the floor.
The pants should reach the soles of the feet and flow along the floor.
Comfortability is always taken into account for fashions and beauty.
Tailors must be skills so as to ensure the wearer has freedom of movement.
Despite it being a long robe, "Ao Dai" is cool to wear.
Synthetic or silk fabrics are best to use because they do not crush and dry quickly.
For this reason "Ao Dai" is a practical uniform for daily wear.
The color can show the wearer’s age and status.
Young girls wear pure white, fully-lined outfits symbolizing their purity.
Older but unmarried girls move into soft pastel shades.
Only married women wear "Ao Dai" in strong, rich colors, usually over white or black pants.
"Ao Dai"is rarely seen in places where manual work is practiced.
In the nineties the Ao dai become popular again.
It has become standard and common attire for female students as well and staff at offices and hotels.
Ao dai nowadays is very popular with different designs and colors.
"Ao Dai"has become the most preferred dress for formal occasions and traditionally ceremonies.
Today, "Ao Dai" has been modified.
Its length is cut shorter usually just below the knee.
Variations in the neck, between boat and mandarin style, are common.
Access to new fabrics have made for some interesting design most visitors to Vietnam admire local tailors’ skills when making ao dai.
It is hard to think of a more elegant, demure and charming outfit, that suits Vietnamese women of different ages, than Ao Dai.
Consumers in many countries are encouraged to consume more products.
From an economic perspective, there is a constructive culprit of development for production, whilst there is a pervasive anxiousness about the adverse impact of shopaholic tendency on the society.
If a greater demand for products is stimulated, the production will be developed to meet this market needs.
The decision of manufacturers is affected by the capacity of consumption for products which is the key contributor to their profits.
Consumers are favorable with their products, thereby an increase in their profits induces to the extending production scales.
For example, Vietnamese noodle corporations, in recent years, have diversified and developed their products thanks to the high demand for instant noodle.
On the other hand, through an increasingly more materialistic mentality along with mass marketing, citizens are getting addicted to shopping.
Instead of exerting their spending efficiently, they are willing to afford to new products which following by trend.
The majority of them have struggled with overspending that triggers to their burden of debt.
Moreover, shopaholic tendency can predispose to break off their responsibility.
For example, their responsibility of mothers for ensuring a balanced and nutritious diet for their kids by home cooked meals will be replaced with habit of buying fast food owing to the available to the convenient food in stores or restaurants.
In conclusion, benefits of encouraging consumption for efficient production from economic perspectives are undeniable.
However, uncontrolled spending and debt as well as bad habits are negative of this trend.
There are many valuable things in life, but friendship may be one of the most important.
A friend may be defined as.
" a person whom you know, like and trust".
But to all, friendship has no clearly defined terminology.
The definition of a friend, and friendship, is based upon our own notions.
True friendship is a feeling of love, sharing and caring.
It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are, without any exaggeration, flattery and pretensions.
It gives a feeling that you are "unique" and that you are "someone" and not a faceless being in the crowd.
A true friend stands by you through thick and thin.
Lasting friendship is indeed, a blessing.
Good friends are great pillars of life.
They help us to stand tall and erect in life.
Friendship can make or break us.
It can lead to good careers and proper living.
It does not matter how often you meet your friends, but how much you care and feel for another in good times as well as in bad times.
True friendship is a great asset in life.
Friends are needed in every stage of life.
Friendship has no age limit.
Every group of people-children, youth, elders, very elderly people, have their friends.
Famous saying states that.
To live life without the experience of friendship, is life without living.
My mother is the most important person in my life.
She is an inspiration to everything I do.
I would not call her a friend, but she is an extraordinary person.
She has been in my life since I was born and she will always be in my life no matter what happens.
She is the one who has suffered to bring me into this world.
I have learnt to love her since the day I was born.
My mother was the first person to teach me to draw and walk, and she was with me when I took my first step ever!
She has taught me to believe in people and not to have grudges against one another.
She always encouraged me to go along when I was ready to give up.
She made sure that I was safe and happy throughout my childhood.
It is the unconditional love that my mother gives to me.
It is hard to describe the feeling that a mother has towards her children.
Mothers give an awful lot of support to their children, whether it involves very visible support or simple back encouragement.
Not only do mothers support their children, but they also often hold the whole family structure together.
When all is well, a mother puts her children before anything else, including their own comfort and happiness.
Describing a mother's love is virtually impossible.
It is a feeling that can only truly be understood by those that experienced it.
Famous saying states that "God could not be everywhere and so he invented mothers!
Garment Technologists can be employed by manufacturers or large, high-street retailers.
Working in the manufacturing and production industry, a technologist has a role in selecting and testing the ideal fabric or material for products.
A clothing/textile technologist works with a variety of fabrics, both man-made and natural fibers, as well as leather, fur, metals and plastics.
As a technologist, you’ll find fabrics or textiles that are fit for purpose and carry out quality control tests.
You’ll work on the development of products, improving production efficiency and quality, while incorporating with those involved in the production process.
Some technologists specialize in research and product development and may implement research to find new ways of using yarns, develop chemicals that may be added into fabrics to make them more waterproof, flame-resistant or shrink-resistant, and experiment with textiles to improve their look, feel, texture and durability.
You will need to have a high level of technical knowledge and strong practical skills, the ability to work as part of a team and to liaise with colleagues in other tasks.
Besides, you have to master organizational skills, to ensure time schedules are adhered to and deadlines are met.
It will be useful if you have got an interest in, and understanding of computer technology.
An idol is a person who has a big influence on your life in many ways.
I consider my Dad as my idol.
He is the most respectable and important person in my life.
He has influenced not only my life but the life of my whole family.
My Dad is working as a Regional Manager in State Bank of India.
He has worked very hard in his entire life to make sure that I and all my family members have everything that we need and do not lack anything.
Since my childhood he has taught me and my siblings’ important values and value for money that we apply in our everyday life.
He is my real life hero and pillar of my life to make me strong and keep moving.
He has taught me how to avoid fighting on little things.
He has always told me to sacrifice things for others and face the hardships.
I discuss my personal problems with my Dad and he always guides me how to deal with them in the most possible way.
Not only I but also my friends discuss their personal issues with my Dad.
He is patient, caring, loving and understanding.
He listens to my ideas about successful life diligently and shows me how to reach that point.
Even in bad situations he keeps himself collected and cool and never loses his temper.
My family plays an important role in my father’s life.
Owing to his job he is always occupied with work pressure.
But then he manages to take out time for us from his busy schedule.
He is the strongest person I have ever known.
He has always guided us to live a spiritual and free life.
He will always be my hero.
To me, he is the best father in the world and my love and respect for him cannot be framed in words.
Environmental pollution has made negative effects on the life of every living things on Earth.
Nearly all of our achievements in the fields of industrial progress, science and technology have been realized at the cost of our health so far.
Even our flora and fauna have been found to be at risk of extinction.
All this really makes us wondering whether all our gains and industrial civilization really enable us to climb the peaks of prosperity or simply bring us down the blind alleys of adversity.
Many programs against environmental pollution are strenuously implemented against the indiscriminate violations committed daily in the name of development.
The environmental pollution is not only caused by the emission from nuclear tests or industries.
The smoke from the automobiles and other vehicles, the increasing use of synthetic detergents, nitrogen insecticides and fertilizers contaminate both air and water.
The water we use to drink the vegetables are all contaminated.
As a result, our world is suffering from a number of incurable diseases.
Nothing in this world is immune, no life is safe and the prospect of this world is bleak.
The factories are mostly built in residential areas and the smoke-emitting vehicles ply through the congestion areas.
Besides causing immense disturbances, it also leads to increasing number of case of pulmonary thrombosis and tuberculosis and various sorts of brain and heart complications.
Air-pollution may cause severe lung diseases, brain-disorder diseases, asthma.
Soil-pollution may negatively affect farm output ratio.
It can also contaminate the groundwater.
Noise-pollution have negative effects on hearing ability.
It can also cause deafness, tiredness, and mental losses.
The heat generated by industries and vehicles causes thermal pollution by raising the environmental temperature of the nearby areas.
The birth of mills and factories is the result of the growth of industry in this machine-predominated period.
As long as they will be there, they must emit smoke, pollute the air and hasten our end by slow-poisoning.
For teenagers, having a job is a way of earning money, just a way of having extra cash for movies or clothes.
It makes us feel independent.
Personally, it made me feel like an adult.
It taught me how to take responsibility and handle my finances.
I had to learn how to take public transportation, interact with my coworkers, work with different types of people, and also learn about punctuality.
In a way, it was almost like I had learned real life skills within 3 months.
I will never forget my first job experience.
It will always be a big part of my maturing and becoming a young adult.
Our supervisors helped us get familiar with Google Apps.
We played with it, did tutorials, did assignments until we knew what we were doing like the backs of our hands.
Finally, after a fortnight we were ready to start on a first project.
We were all assigned some clients and began building websites for them.
It was an interesting experience and I loved every step of it.
Not only did we build websites for clients, we did onsite training for different companies and helped them get acquaintance with Google Apps.
It required us to speak in front of public and be willing to answer questions.
It was nerve-wracking but my supervisor was there every step of the way, guiding and correcting my mistakes.
Week by week, time passed.
Before I knew it, it was the last day of my internship.
Both of my supervisors gave us some useful advice on furthering our future careers.
My internship has taught me many beneficial things.
They are to always have an open mind and be willing to work in any type of environment, to be willing to adapt to a new work place and be respectful and kind to not only my future supervisors but my coworkers as well.
What I have learned in the span of three months will always be a big part of me growing up.
I’m looking forward to taking what I’ve learned and applying it.
Whoever you are, you have the right to dream of your future job.
I also have one.
That is my desire to become a teacher.
Just thinking of my job, I feel so happy.
My friends often ask me that.
Why do you choose teaching?.
I smile.
I choose this job, because I love children so much.
I want to take care of them, teach them how to read, how to write, how to listen and show them the beautiful things of this life.
Teaching is similar to growing a tree up, you must have patience,carefulness, and passion.
And one of the important reasons that makes me choose this job is my parents.
They hope that I can complete your dream.
In Viet Nam, the salary of a teacher is quite low, but I still want to become a teacher, simply becauseI love this job and I believe in my love, as well as my passion for this job.
In the future, I will become a good teacher.
And now, I’m trying my best to complete the program in university to make my dream come true.
Smoking cigarettes is an expensive habit.
You can see, the average price per pack of cigarettes isabout 1 dollar, people who smoke 2 packs of cigarettes per daywill spend $2 one day on their habit.
At the end of a year those smokers will incur a debt.
Since smoking has an offensive odor that permeates into clothing,stuffed carpets and furniture, smokers often find that they must have those items cleaned more frequently than nonsmokers do.
Furthermore, a smoker would pay a lot of money for many diseasescaused by smoking.
Although it’s difficult to sum the cost of those additional expenses, I can say that the expenses do contribute to making smoking become a very expensive habit.
Watching television is my favourite activity I like doing in my free time.
I enjoy watching somesport programs on Saturday afternoons and movies and cartoons on Sunday mornings.
Ialways watch televisionduring the week after I have done all my homework.
At night, I like to watchcomedies and movies.
If I have a lot of homework, I will arrange my schedule so that I will have time to watch at least 1 of my favorite shows.

Only the answer is the sacrifice of mother.

May be, they come back to their friendly family and prepare for Tet holiday.
My mother will be asking my sister .

since the very beginning of my schooling day as far as I remember, Ihave had an attraction for Mathematics.
Mathematics always gives me extra energy and satisfaction in my study.

Also, he teaches me with a great technique of visual representation.
He createsa collection of intuitive Youtube videos for my favorite subject.

Only logical thinking is sufficient for this subject.
secondly, Mathematics always remains evergreen in demand in the field of education.
Lastly, Without it many life goals cannot be achieved.
It is the only subject in which anyone can score full marks andin almost case marks can be improved.
So these are the reasons why I have selected this subject to be my most favoriteone.
I practicemathematics by writing various formulas regularly.
This helps to give outimmediate ideasto solve any problems quickly.
I enjoy practicing critical sums of maths.
I always score above 95% in this subject.
It give me a lot of confidence and enjoyment.
Our environment is getting worse day by day, and we are suffering forour mistakes.
It's getting harder and harder for our families to stay healthy with all the bad thingsaround us every day.
We are affected by our environment, andmore and more people are found to be caught with diseases.
This could affect our families and our future one day.
We might not be able to see all of the bad things in our environment, but for sure, they are existing.
Although certain groups are most vulnerable, toxic substances in the environment affect every person andall of us have to take responsibility for them.
This saying supports my opinion about the cause because it is saying there aredangerous substances in our environment that we are responsible for.
We are getting sick and even dying because of the bad thingshuman are putting into the environment.
These health problems killed around more than 15.000victims in the year that followed.
Approximately 100.000 people still suffer from chronic diseases which are consequencesof gas exposure, today.
This is also stating that the things in our air are killing us.
All of this dangerous toxicsare the cause of getting diseases which are killing the people we love.
The winter of Hanoi starts from December and may last until the February, with the average temperature of 15-17°C.
Sometimes it drops to below 10°C and the high humidity will make the weather a little bit colder.
Remember to bring warm clothes if you don't want to get a cold when visiting a tropical country.
Winter often brings a sad feeling, because the sky is often dark and gloomy.
However, Hanoi seems to have its busiest days of the year and streets are more crowded than usual during working hours as people are in rush to complete all the remaining works and prepare for Tet holiday.
The cold weather enables people living in Hanoi or visitors to enjoy the tasty hot food like hotspot or grilled dishes.
Hanoi in early winter morning, the mist makes special beauty for the city.
Somewhere people carrying bunches of flowers cycle slowly in the quiet air.
Men prefer a hot cup of tea, sitting on the sidewalk evaporates, watching the flow of people back and forth.
Hanoi young women walk downstreet in beautiful clothes.
The children wear tightly when they are out, though only playing at doorstep.
The old, with glasses of cold beer, talk about life.
We can also catch the image of street venders struggling when it rains.
The winter is one of many beauties of Hanoi.
It's worth coming and enjoying the atmosphere in Hanoi.
In the past, I always thought that game online was a bad thing, because there were many people studying lazily and making their parents worry because of playing games too much.
But when I grow up, I realize that I mistake passion for addiction.
As the same, game online always has advantages and disadvantages.
The hotter a method of entertainment becomes, the more young people try it.
They don't need to know how the game is.
They will spend time on it, forget to work on the exercise, neglect their study at school.
At first, they want to keep up with the trend but then, it's hard for them to leave out that habit, which leads to serious consequences.
They attach importance on win, spend a lot of money on game to satisfy themselves.
They forget that playing game is just a means of entertainment after stressful classes so they easily get addicted.
However, there are some advantage of game online.
Firstly, we can react in the fastest way in all circumstances, we can become a game creator and have good team-work skills.
Secondly, we can explore the way of any game that is controlled, find the rules in each game and developed their idea in the future.
You can also have best friend and live more responsibly.
The most important thing is that people who play game have happy time, relax to concentrate on learning or working.
Game online is not bad, but their way play make it become bad.
Let try on playing a game one time and you won't feel disappointed.
When I was thirteen years old, Women's volleyball team of Viet Nam took part in the competition with other countries in the Southeast Asia region.
They played really wonderfully and I admired Mrs. Pham Thi Kim Hue who was a talent and beautiful female volleyball player.
Then, I decided to sign in the volleyball club in my school, I practiced some of basic volleyball skills in this club.
Of course, my parent didn't know because I didn't tell them.
At that time, I dreamed that I would become a as good volleyball player as Mrs. Pham Thi Kim Hue.
Every afternoon when classes ended, I played with my team (some of members in club) in two hours, we relaxed about 15 minutes, told some of the jokes, smiled together very happily.
After other members left, I stayed with hope.
The team leader could teach me more.
About a week later, my body hurt and appeared so much scratches, especially my arms.
Therefore, I hadn't been accustomed to strong activities for a long time before.
I consoled myself and continued practicing.
One day, while I were playing volleyball, I fell down in the slippery floor.
As a result, my right arm was broken, my parent was worried, their tear made me feel remorseful.
Since then, I sometime play volleyball but I realize.
Only love is never enough, your dream will be not perfect without the passion.
The past, I don't like the cooking.
One day, I just raised my head to surprise two eyes starting at me when I was holding a piece of almond cake.
He said.
can you make it?
I like it so much.
The fact, it was my friend but Ipromised that.
I will make a almond cake for him.
So, he was look handsome .
Today, I get up early and go to supermarket to buy some of raw material.
Needinga lot of ingredients.
1 cup sliced almonds, butter, purpose flour, 4 egg yolks, 2 large egg whites, whole milk, vanilla extract, fresh lemon juice, black berries, raspberries, salt, sugar.
After make a almond cake, I feel this very interesting.
It's too difficult to complete.
May be, I should make it in the future, the more one time.
I hope he like a cake I make painfully.
I will give for him, tomorrow.
I have never imagined to make a cake that have many processing stages.
But I promised, I will try my best.
Everybody in my family believe that.
I don't love my dad as the same the different children.
Because when I was 2 months old,I have always cried loudly whenever he come on, until I was 10 years old,I rarely talked to him.
I didn't know why was I do?
May be, I loved my father so much!
My dad is regularly busy, he has to go away my home, such as a working trip.
So, I live with my mom, my sister and my grandparents, I looking forward to the date he come back.
Despite the fact that I often cry, hide behind the door when I see him.
I keep in eye of the dad's action I feel happy so he is beside me.
If he take care of my sister the better than me, I will cry again.
My father is a quiet, taciturn and good man, he make people fell safe and comfortable.
He always buys gift for me, he hope to close to me and see his daughter scurrying, the walked up to him, gave him a kiss on the check and say.
I love you, dad.
Many time, I imagined this and promised myself that.
I will live by my true feelings, won't fear the break up again.
A long time past, my dad was retired but I went to school away from home so we rarely see each other.
When I have a free time, I phone to him and talk to funny stories that I see, talk to boyfriend that I like.
Suddenly, I realize one thing, without my father, is not the more perfect man appear in my life.
Having happiness, having sadness, we need accustomed to it.
I were come back my childhood, I will hide in the cabinet to look over the dad's action.
One thing is the most important in the present.
he have known my feelings.
Lunar New Year Festival often falls between late January and early February.
it is among the most important holidays in Vietnam.
Officially, the festival includes the 1st, 2nd and 3rd day in Lunar Calendar.
however, Vietnamese people often spend about nearly a month to celebrate this special event.
Tet Holiday gets its beginning marked with the first day in the Lunar Year.
however, its preparation starts long before that.
One week before the holiday, in the 23rd day of the last Lunar month, is East Day—a ritual worshiping Kitchen Gods (Tao Cong).
It is believed that each year on this day, these Gods go to heaven to tell Jade Emperor about all activities of households on earth.
On the New Year's Eve, they return to earth to continue their duties as taking care of families.
On the New Year's Day, the first ones who come to visit households—called first-foot—are very important and hence need to be well chosen, as they are believed to hold in their hands the entire luck of the family in New Year (Tan Nien).
After that, till the third day or even the fourth day of Tet, individuals meet relatives, friends and colleagues, wishing them all kinds of good things like happiness, health and success.
Many people ponder what they should do for a vacation and I realized a lot of people don't seem to share our views about traveling.
I believe it's very important to see the world and different cultures.
It lets us open our minds to new things and we get to experience life in exiting different ways.
Traveling gives us the opportunity to disconnect from our regular life.
You get to forget your problems for a few weeks, it can also help you figure things out that you would not have understood without the distance traveling can give you.
We all have crazy schedules, work and a family to take care of, going away alone or with some friends can give you distance and perhaps even make you realize how important these people are for you .
Like the saying says.
we never know what we have until we lose it.
Another great benefit is the relaxation you get to do.
It's nice to live life to its fullest and enjoy a stress free time with yourself.
Going on vacation lets us recharge our "batteries" by disconnecting us from our regular life.
When we come back we feel invigorated and we are happy to be back in our day to day routine.
It's a very good stress remover that has a lot more to give than most people are willing to accept.
Traveling increases our knowledge and widens our perspective.
To view new customs, different ways of living is fantastic for the mind.
It gives us a new perspective about life and especially our life, it can help us change some of our habits or even create new ones.
When I travel I usually make it a point to try new food, some cultures don't have fries in their diet and they are all skinny, others use spices to give taste and not oils or fats.
Discovering different values and ways to get by in life is really interesting.
You also need to visit exotic new places and discover what this wonderful world has to offer.
New experiences increase our resourcefulness by living situations you would never encounter at home, this is great experience for you when you come back to your routine.
I have noticed that people who traveled a lot in life were ready to embrace change and have a natural ability of overcoming problems that others would frown upon.
When traveling with friends or family it creates memories for a lifetime.
These memories will create a bond that nothing can erase no matter what happens with the friendship.
It can also give a new perspective on the relationship and cement the bond forever.
It also gives nice stories to tell people afterwards, you can create photo albums about your trips and when you feel nostalgic you can take an hour of your life and experience the trips again by looking at your pictures.
It's never been this cheap to travel.
With soaring oil prices the cheap travel era might be coming to an end.
However there are still many budget airlines fighting for your dollar right now.
With the internet and all the new technology, you can plan your trip exactly the way you want it.
You can choose your budget, the duration of the trip and what you want to do.
I suggest to read travel blogs and see what others are experiencing, you can save yourself a few hurdles by reading about their trip.
If you have some time off I suggest to take that trip and experience what life has to offer.
Don't wait or tell yourself there will be a better time to go.
Take the risk, the opportunity and buy your plane ticket right now and leave.
When you come back you won't be sorry that you left, on the contrary you will be thinking of your next trip the second you come back from the airport.
Feel free to let me know how traveling helped you out, what new experiences you lived and how they helped you in your life.
Michael Jackson is one of my favorite singers.
He is very famous, so most of all people in the world know him, at least his name.
I began to listen to his songs because I was recommended them by my friend, and I was really attracted by them.
I have two reasons why I like him.
To me, one of my best friends is Thành .
Thành is only over eighteen but he is well developed.
so he is thought to be twenty or more.
He has black hair, a broad forehead, a straight nose and bright eyes.
He is very good-looking.
He has a kind heart and is easy to get on with everybody.
We have been friends for a very long time.
The deeper our mutual understanding becomes the more we feel closely attached to each other.
Thành and I are keen on learning.
We are the best pupils in our class.
Thành is always at the top.
He is good at every subject, but he never shows pride in his abilities and always tries to learn harder.
Thành's family is not rich enough.
His parents are retired workers.
Realizing the hardships of his parents, although he is absorbed in his study, he often spends most of his spare time doing useful things to help his parents in their old age.
He gets up early in the morning to have enough time to deliver newspapers to subscribers before going to school.
After school in the afternoon, he repairs bicycles and motorbikes.
Therefore the money he gets from his manual job is sufficient for his school fees and for his parents' presents.
I like Thành very much because of his honesty and straight forwardness.
He is always ready to help his weak friends in their study.
as a result, lots of friends, thanks to his whole-hearten help, have become good ones.
My name is Tram and I am from Binh Dinh province/Vietnam.
I am currently studying Finance and Economics at Van Lang University.
I was raised in Binh Dinh and when I was 18 I moved to Ho Chi Minh city to take my university study.
Last year I went to Da Nang city to join the school's exchange program.
During my exchange I went backpacking with other backpackers from all over the city to other province/city across Vietnam.
It was a fun experience.
I think I have been fortunate enough to be able to live in different parts of our country and thus be able to broaden my horizon.
I have a strong interest in banking and financial services industry.
The reason is I'd like to leverage my detail-oriented mind and apply the skills and knowledge that I have attained throughout my degree courses.
I see myself as a people-oriented and over-achiever person.
I demonstrated this through working in various group projects with different types of people in which I had been able to perform well.
My strengths are my attitude that I like to take challenges that I CAN do it, self motivated person, self disciplined I am a good team player as well as has a good ability to lead the team.
I can adopt to any kind of environment.
I am a good listener and quick learner.
My weakness is I can not tolerate any leniency in work My short term goal is I want a such a platform where I can grow my career along with the organisation growth like yours and.
My Long term goal is I want to be one of the reason for the success of the organisation and I want to see your organisation as a bench mark to other organisations.
I would like to be part of your company to further develop myself in banking field and to use my capabilities to serve both your company and your clients.
Thats all about me sir.
Thank you for giving me such a wonderful opportunity.
Friendship is the most valuable relationship in the life of a person instead of having many important things in life.
No one of us has a complete and satisfied life if we lack faithful friendship.
Everyone needs a good and loyal friend to share bad or good life events, enjoy happy moments and share unbearable events of the life.
A good and balanced human interaction is very necessary for the survival of everyone.
Good friends share each other's emotions or sentiments which bring feeling of well being and mental satisfaction.
A friend is a person whom one can know deeply, like and trust forever.
Instead of being some similarity in the nature of two persons involved in the friendship, they have some different traits but they need each other without changing their uniqueness.
Generally, friends motivate each other without criticizing but sometimes good friends criticize to bring some positive changes in each other.
Environment is an essential part of our life.
A clean environment is necessary for a peaceful and healthy life.
An environment is the natural surroundings which helps human beings, animals and other living things to grow and develop naturally.
But nowadays, our environment is disturbing in many different ways.
Any type of disturbance in the nature's balance affects the environment totally.
It does not only ruin human lives but also affects on all living beings.
We can save our environment with the little step taken by everyone on the earth.
We should reduce the amount of waste, throwing wastes properly to its place only.
and many other simple ways.
It is very important to save environment for human existence.
When we protect the environment, we are protecting ourselves and our future as well.
Friendship is one of the most precious presents of life.
Friendship makes life, sweet and pleasant experience.
Friendship is indeed, an asset in life.
Friendship is good and necessary.
Man cannot live all alone because he is a social being.
He needs someone to share his joys and sorrows.
There goes a saying"Friendship increases happiness and diminishes misery by doubling our joy and dividing our grief".
Friendship can make or break us.
It all depends on how we choose our friends.
We spent much of our time with them.
Their mental outlook, behaviour, attitudes affect us too.
Today, many youngsters have become social nuisance mainly due to bad friends.
Therefore, we have to choose our friends very carefully.
We have to remember the maxim "All that glitters is not gold".
We have to distinguish between fair-weather friends and true friends.
True friends remain with us through thick and thin while fair-weather friends are found only during sunny days.
True friendship is a feeling of love, sharing and caring.
It is a feeling that someone understands and appreciates you as you are, without any flattery.
It gives a feeling that you are 'wanted' and that you are 'someone' and not a faceless being in the crowd.
True friendship knows no boundaries of caste, creed, race and sex.
Good friends are great pillars of life.
A person who has true friends in life is lucky enough.
It does not matter how often you meet your friends, but how much you care and feel for another in good times as well as in bad times.
Everybody has their own type of hobby.
Mine tends to be a little delicate, and it requires me to put in such tender care and love.
That is, gardening.
My boyfriend and I live together in a small house, even though the size of the house itself is not ideal compare to other houses nowadays, but it's still fully equipped.
And, the only one special thing that makes our house stand out, is our backyard garden.
My boyfriend shares the same interest for gardening as me.
We always spend times together taking care of the garden every day.
Covering the entire yard is a grass carpet of deep green.
The garden of us gathers a diversity of colors from many kinds of flower such as Roses, Lilies, Sunflowers.
Likewise, our garden is also covered by one such soothing aroma from the bushes of Orange Jasmine (hoa nguyệt quế).
Watering, fertilizing, as well as pruning (tỉa lá), are some small works that we do to take care of our lovely garden.
They might sound simple, but in order to complete such those small acts, you have to give in your real effort and love.
If you could do so, I truly believe you yourself would be able to own a spectacular garden that blooms out not only lively colors, but also a unique fragrance, just like our garden.
An ideal family with 2 children.
Previously, Our Ancestor often thought that the more children we had, the more happines we found.
However, in reality, a large family will lead to a lot of problems for the family in particular and for the development of society in general.
Many social studies have shown an ideal family is a family with two children.
This is a perfect model for couples with a modern lifestyle because it can overcome various problems that can occur in a family.
Specifically here is how people take care of their children.
In 1 minute, your children may hurt themselves by playing with sharp objects such as knife.
Many kids have met tragic accident when they participate in playful activities by water without adult supervision.
So parents will take care for children easier and more attentive when they only have two children.
Nurturing is another challenge for parents.
However, according to a government report by a government agency, the children raised in families with two children often have better behavior than the kids who have too many brothers and sisters.
The children born and raised in a family with few children will get more attention and lessons from from their parents.
Instead of wresting love from their parents, these children are also gainmore opportunities to be heard and to share.
Another problem will be solved when a family decides to have few children is finance.
We can not deny the necessity of money in guarantee a fulfilled life and a brighter future for our children.
Money will be used to pay for education and health care fee when children are sick.
On the contrary, in a overcrowded home, parents will be faced more financial burden, especially when the kids are born closely with their siblings.
The problem can becomes worse if the family fell into difficult circumstances and do not have enough ability to send their children to school, the children will easily involve into crime matters and became sorrow not only for their parents but also for the society.
My hobby is reading knowledgeable and interesting books in my square time.
Reading is such a good habit which healthy for your brain and keeps your brain functioning actively.
Reading is a wonderful way to keeps you relax and happy.
For me, there is nothing makes me happier than to have a stack of books on my nightstand to attack on a night when there is no alarm clock waiting the next morning.
It's the great source of enjoyment, inspiration , instruction, and knowledge.
Reading book can make us disciplined, punctual, loyal and most importantly a very successful person in this life.
While reading books, noone can feel disturb or alone.
I think this hobby is more precious than other precious stones in the world.
It can provide us noble thoughts, ideas to work in many fields and high level of knowledge.
Interesting and knowledgeable book is like best friend of the someone who likes to read.
Book is one part of my beautiful life and reading book has definitelybeen my favourite hobby.
I will be able to never forget the interesting moment when my father gave me the first book which is full of colourful pictures.
I was very delighted though I difficultly understood what were there in that book.
I read wherever, whenever, and whatever kinds of books, from short story, comic, to novel and many more.
My father always encourages me to read book and He buys me many useful and interesting books.
Books are like my friends who can teach me many things over the world.
They let me know of a lot of beautiful places and the history of our country and many others.
My tears come from those books and so do my happy laughters.
Most free time of mine is spent on discovering books, books are very useful and so great.
Reading books is the most interesting indoor activities that you should try.
It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system.
Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase.
There are two key factors behind this trend.
For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use.
The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet.
As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production.
In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a "stock" economy to a "flow" economy.
This phenomenon has been emphasised by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users.
However, a new imperative-sustainable development – offers an opportunity for adapting the EU，s common transport policy.
This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy.
The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years‟ time, that is by 2040.
The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing.
This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of transport.
In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport.
However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton.
The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics, technology).
However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regional cohesion.
It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion‟s share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes.
It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance.
The tallest building in Europe is nearly complete.
Rising above a new waterfront complex in St.Petersburg, Russia, the Lakhta Center's tower stands at 462 meters (1,516 feet) tall, making it the city's first supertall building (one measuring 300 meters or above).
The structure is now the northernmost skyscraper in the world, according to its developers.
The 87-story tower twists a full 90 degrees from its foundation to its top, like a winding needle.
This makes it one of the world's tallest examples of a twisted skyscraper design.
Its soaring height is offset by a lower mixed-use building with a 260-meter-long (853-foot-long) facade.Residential and commercial space will be installed up to a height of 360 meters (1,181 feet), above which an observation deck and restaurant will offer breathtaking views over the Gulf of Finland.
The Lakhta Center takes the title of Europe's tallest building from Moscow's Federation Tower, completed in 2017, which stands at 374 meters (1,227 feet).
Moscow is also home to five of the next six entries in the list, interrupted only by London's Shard, which was briefly the continent's tallest in 2012, at 310 meters (1,016 feet) tall.
The firm is set to move in by the end of 2019.
According to Philip Nikandrov, one of the architects involved with the project, the exterior of the building will be completed by the end of this summer, although the interior fitting will continue into 2019.
Drone images show the main tower's impressive silhouette, which was designed to symbolize a flame -- a distinctive feature of Gazprom's logo.
Every year on May 5th of the lunar calendar, some countries China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam have Mid-year Festival.
In China, on this day, they celebrate a festival called Dragon Bloat Festival.
In Vietnam, the festival celebrated on May 5th is called Tet Doan Ngo, Worm-killing Festivalof Vietnamese.
Some researchers think that the celebration has its origin in China.
There is a legend Qu Yuan – Chinese poet who lived during the Warring States period of ancient China.
In Vietnam, we call him Khuat Nguyen.
He was a faithful person but living in the empire in decline.
He hindered the king from making some bad decisions.
Other officials devised false stories about him.
The king did not follow his advice and hated him.
He was so sad and drowned himself in the Mich La, China on May 5th of the lunar calendar.
Chinese people regretted the person having a clear heart.
Every year, on this day, people made cakes with five-color strings and dropped them to the river to offer Khuat Nguyen.
They tied five-color strings on the cakes in order to make fishes afraid and do not dare to eat the cakes.
They also poured rice into bamboo tubes and dropped them into the river.
The custom gradually spread through some nearby countries.
Vietnamese people call this day Worm-killing Festival because most farmers start killing worms on their rice fields and orchards.
Vietnamese ancestors had told us a story about Doi Truan who taught farmers how to kill a lot of worms in fruits and rice.
He offered Banh gio (a kind of Pyramid sticky rice cake), fruits to Gods in front of a house.
He told that if all farmers did the same things on the same day every year, all worms will be weaker and killed easily.
The man had disappeared after helping killing worms.
Nowadays, grandparents tell their children about the stories, teach them to be grateful to ancestors and the country's tradition.
FLC chairman to increase stakes.
Trinh Van Quyet, chairman of FLC, has registered to increase his ownership in the property company by 2.1 percentage points.
He said in a recent statement he would buy 15 million shares between June 26 and July 25 to increase his stake to 23.3 percent.
With FLC trading at VND4,200 (18 cents) at the time of publishing, the acquisition will cost him around VND63 billion ($2.7 million).
Quyet had said last year he would spend VND1.5-2 trillion ($65-86 million) in 2020 to acquire more FLC shares. The share price has fallen by 11 percent this year.
He has been selling his stake in FLC Faros, a construction arm of FLC, from 51.3 percent to 4.17 percent for over VND900 billion ($39 million), and resigned as chairman of the company.
An FLC Faros spokesperson said the divestment could mean Quyet wants to focus more on the parent company and the carrier it owns, Bamboo Airways.
FLC, a developer of resorts and golf courses, expects a loss of VND1.96 trillion ($84 million) this year due to the impacts of the coronavirus.

Insurance company to cover VND 3.5-billion treatment cost of British pilot.
An insurance company will bear the cost of VND 3.5 billion to treat the 91st patient, a British pilot, who was the country's most critical case of Covid-19, at the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
The company has sent a payment confirmation to the hospital, paying the entire cost of treatment of the 43-year-old man from March 18 to May 22, Nguoi Lao Dong Online reported.
A representative of the hospital said the treatment cost escalated when the patient needed the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to allow his lungs and heart to improve and function properly.
The patient also suffered blood clotting disorders and the anticoagulants sold in the local market failed to treat him, the representative said, adding that, as such, the Ministry of Health allowed other anticoagulants from foreign markets to be imported.

Father, son jailed for raping disabled woman.
A Binh Thuan Province court has sentenced a father and son to three and nine years each for raping, impregnating an intellectually disabled woman.
Nguyen Thanh Tam, 43, was jailed for three years while his 20-year-old son Nguyen Huu Thanh got nine years after the latter was identified as the father of the baby, the court ruled Monday.
Both were forced to pay VND70 million ($3,016) in compensation for mental trauma and supporting the mother in raising the child.
According to the indictment, Thanh and the victim were cousins.
In late 2018, he visited her home in Ham Thuan Nam District in the south-central Binh Thuan Province, noting she lived alone.
Thanh later forced her into a room where he raped her on two different occasions in the following days.
Thanh's father also visited the victim's home where he continued to rape her.
Tam threatened to kill her if she revealed the secret.
In mid-2019, the victim's mother noticed something amiss in her daughter and took her to a hospital where doctors found she was around six months pregnant.
After the victim told her mother what had happened, she called on local police to launch a criminal investigation.
In November 2019, the victim gave birth to a boy, DNA results confirming Thanh to be the father.
The Central Institute of Mental Forensics in the southern Dong Nai Province concluded the victim suffered intellectual disability with limited cognition and behavior control.

Vietnam to allow int'l soccer betting payments via e-wallets.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing to allow soccer and horse racing bettors to make payments via e-wallets, bank accounts or prepaid mobile phone accounts, as part of a new legal document, for which the ministry is seeking feedback, to replace a decree over betting on horse and dog racing and international soccer events.
The prevailing regulations allow people to only place bets via mobile phones and pay for betting tickets via bank accounts.
However, with the rapid growth in technology and cashless payment methods, it is essential to expand payment methods to create favorable conditions for bettors, the ministry explained.
Since each payment method has its own upside, bettors can opt to link their betting accounts with their bank accounts, e-wallets, or prepaid mobile phone subscriptions.
These payment methods can also help in terms of rewarding bettors, wherein they can get cash rewards transferred to their linked accounts by betting companies or agents and can withdraw the money in line with the prevailing regulations on e-payment.
The ministry suggested these payment accounts must be opened at cashless payment service providers or e-wallet operators in accordance with Vietnam's regulations on non-cash payment.
Moreover, as per existing regulations, the betting sum of money must be at least VND10,000 each time, and the daily maximum amount set for each player placing a bet at a certain betting firm is VND1 million.
Any change to the quota must be sent to the Government for consideration and approval.
Accordingly, the finance ministry suggested eliminating these betting limits.
Instead, under the new decree, the ministry should coordinate with the relevant ministries and agencies to present plans to the prime minister on betting limits for different periods.
Further, the Government leader should take additional responsibility for revising the betting limits for each period in the new decree, said the ministry.

Binh Chanh begins demolishing Tram Chim resort.
After a long period of suspension due to the Tet holiday and the coronavirus pandemic, Binh Chanh District in HCMC on June 23 restarted tearing down numerous facilities at Gia Trang Quan, also known as the Tram Chim Resort, which was illegally developed in Tan Quy Tay Commune.
A representative from the government of the commune told Thanh Nien Online that the large-scale commercial complex was developed on land which is for agricultural purposes only.
The demolition is aimed at forcing Tran Thi Minh Trang, the owner of the resort, to restore the status of the land covering an area of over 7,260 square meters.
The authorities had earlier demanded that Trang demolish the illegal portions of the resort but she remained defiant, the representative added.
At 8.00 a.m. today, a working team of 200 people and vehicles were dispatched to the resort for the demolition, which is expected to be completed within one week.
Tram Chim Resort, which was built in 2015, comprises 65 guest rooms, 16 karaoke rooms, 13 sauna rooms, and many other facilities.
Following a decision to demolish Tram Chim Resort, the Binh Chanh government on November 19, 2019, asked 17 individuals concerned to practice self-criticism as they failed to closely cooperate and address the illegal construction, thus prolonging the entire process.
When the Binh Chanh government began demolishing the construction work at the resort, Tran Thi Minh Trang filed a lawsuit against the district government and demanded that it revoke the Binh Chanh chairman’s decision demanding the illegal facilities at the resort be destroyed.
Trang said the demolition has caused heavy losses for her.
Calling for cryptocurrency investment is illegal.
A former top police official asked local residents to stay clear of persons calling for investments in cryptocurrencies to avoid being cheated, as drives to mobilize capital for the crypto business are unlawful in Vietnam.
Besides breaking Vietnamese laws, investors in cryptocurrencies could also face risks.
Cryptocurrencies or virtual money and payments made using such money are not legally recognized in the country, according to Vu Hoang Kien, former deputy head of the Criminal Police Department, under the Ministry of Public Security.
The police have cracked down on many crypto rings so far.
Many investors have been lured through the simple investment procedures and interest rate as high as 90% per month, and have been consequently defrauded for up to hundreds of billions of dong.
Some swindlers have even offered an astounding interest rate of 120% per month to attract investors.
Kien advised locals not to be tempted by the high-interest rates in the crypto business, as this could mean going against Vietnamese laws and lead to substantial debt for themselves, their families and friends.
According to Nguyen Nam Hao from the Police Department for Corruption, Smuggling, and Economic Crimes, despite the many warnings issued on the matter, many locals are still investing in cryptocurrencies.
To date, only the Government’s Decree 96 stipulates administrative fines at VND150 million-VND200 million for individuals that issue, supply, and use unlawful payment methods, including Bitcoins and other virtual currencies.

Heat wave forecast to hit central, northern regions.
Localities in the northern and central regions are expected to brace for a heatwave early this week, from June 22-24, with high temperatures likely rising up to 42 degrees Celsius in some areas.
These regions suffer the high temperatures due to the impact of a high heat pressure in the west which expands its scale to the southeast, coupled with Foehn wind, according to the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Weather Forecasting.
The hot wave will likely send the temperatures soaring above 35 degrees Celsius from 10 to 18 hours per day, in addition to the low humidity of 30%-50%.
Specifically, in the northwest region, the extreme weather could kick off high temperatures in the provinces of Son La and Hoa Binh at between 35 and 38 degrees Celsius, even above 39 degrees in some areas today, June 22.
As for the northeastern region and the capital city of Hanoi, local people could experience the hottest days with temperatures ranging between 36 and 39 degrees Celsius.
Meanwhile, thundery showers could spread across some areas in the Central Highlands and southern regions, with monsoon blowing at level three. Lightning, hail, and sudden squalls may happen during thundershowers.
AFF Cup format to remain unchanged despite Vietnam suggestion.
The ASEAN Football Federation has decided not to change the home-and-away format of the 2020 AFF Cup.
At an online AFF conference on June 11 the Vietnam Football Federation suggested the event should be played in just one or two countries if the Covid-19 pandemic is not controlled across the region by the end of this year.
In Vietnam, the outbreak has been controlled and there has been no community transmission for over two months, making it a favorite to be host or joint host if its proposal had been accepted.
Vietnam is also the defending champion.
But the AFF, after considering the suggestion, decided not to change the format, and teams will play each other at home and away just like the 2018 edition.
It said the 2022 World Cup qualifiers will also take place at the end of this year with their format unchanged, which is playing home and away matches, so it would be unreasonable for AFF to change the format of their event.

Deputy Director-General of Vietnam Customs Nguyen Duong Thai said Thursday that preliminary investigations have found no evidence that tax money was lost to alleged bribery by plastic appliances maker Tenma Vietnam.
Authorities are still investigating the allegation that the company, based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, bribed Vietnamese officials JPY25 million ($215000) to reduce its tax liability.

To avoid the tax, the company paid a senior customs official VND2 billion ($86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August 2019 Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, of JPY89 million ($826,400).
The company had then paid VND3 billion ($129,000) in cash to tax officials to get the amount reduced to $24,300.

British pilot no longer needs lung transplant.
A lung transplant considered for Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot, is no longer necessary following a recovery.
Luong Ngoc Khue, head of the Ministry of Health's department of diagnosis and treatment, said Wednesday the 43-year-old man in HCMC, who beat Covid-19 after two months but remains under treatment due to lung infection, is now recovering well and can breathe on his own.
He's fully conscious and capable of coherent verbal communication, Khue said.
Sức mạnh cơ bắp chân tay và chức năng hô hấp của anh đã hồi phục.
In May, the health ministry considered a lung transplant for the British pilot as his condition at the time was much more severe.
Computed tomography scan results showed that fibrosis had solidified most of his lungs, and he constantly relied on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to stay alive.
But as his condition progressed, his lungs slowly got better. He was finally taken off ventilators last week, and has breathed on his own since.
He has now been in treatment for three months, the longest period for any Covid-19 patient in Vietnam.
The country has recorded 335 Covid-19 cases so far, with only ten active infections left and no deaths. It has gone over two months without community transmission.

Chinese contractor withdraws demand for US$50m for Hanoi railway project.
Following meetings between Chinese contractor China Railway 6 Bureau Group and the Vietnamese transport authority, the Chinese contractor has withdrawn its request of US$50 million for the operation of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi.
The Vietnamese transport authority fully understands the obstacles encountered by the Chinese contractor but the payment of this sum of money is unjustifiable.
The Vietnamese side only makes payments based on the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract and in line with Vietnam’s laws, said Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Ngoc Dong.
In addition, the transport ministry has requested the relevant agencies to expedite the project so it can be put into service this year, as requested by the prime minister.
Regarding the return of Chinese personnel to Vietnam after travel restrictions due to Covid-19 were eased, Deputy Minister Dong confirmed that 28 Chinese experts have arrived in Vietnam.
The remaining 100 Chinese personnel are following certain procedures to return to the country.
The Chinese experts are expected to enter Vietnam by train through the northern province of Lao Cai.

Ministry considers postponing school opening day to August 15.
The Ministry of Education and Training is considering deferring the first day of the 2020-2021 school year until August 15 instead of August 1 and extending the summer vacation for students, according to the VnExpress news site.
According to the initial plan, the first day of school for kindergartens, high schools and vocational schools was slated for August 1, 2020.
The opening ceremony for the new school year would be held on September 5, 2020.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 2019-2020 academic year will end on July 15, one and a half months later than scheduled.
Therefore, if the 2020-2021 academic year begins on August 1 as initially planned, the summer vacation will only be for two weeks.
Although the 2019-2020 school year is scheduled to end on July 15, some provinces and cities such as Nghe An have accelerated the study program to end the school year before July, thus ensuring students enjoy a longer vacation.
In Hanoi, senior high schools such as Nguyen Du and Trung Vuong are holding the final exams for students, while Nguyen Tat Thanh High School and HUS High School for Gifted Students have already ended the 2019-2020 school year.

Pilot error reason for Vietjet plane skidding off runway.
The aviation incident involving a Vietjet passenger aircraft skidding off a runway in HCMC last weekend as serious, Transport Minister Nguyen Van The noted that it was mainly the fault of the pilot.
Amid the heavy downpour and strong winds on Sunday afternoon, the pilot should have accurately evaluated the weather conditions before landing to ensure safety.
He received instructions from air traffic controllers while landing, but he has the right to decide whether to land or not.
He could have asked for permission to divert the plane and land at another airport, the minister told the local media on the sidelines of the ninth session of the 14th National Assembly on June 15.
The official noted that an investigation team from the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam (CAAV) would decode the plane’s black box to determine why the pilot decided to touch down amid the poor weather conditions.
Commenting on a CAAV press release stating that the weather was the leading cause of the incident, Minister The said the CAAV investigators would work to determine the exact cause of the accident and announce their final decision.
The two foreign pilots operating the plane that skidded off the runway have been suspended from service and their licenses have been seized pending the investigation.

Vietjet pilots’ licenses seized after the accident.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) has suspended two foreign pilots from work and seized their licenses after a Vietjet aircraft skidded off the runway while landing in HCMC yesterday afternoon.
It also suspended six flight attendants and formed a team to investigate the incident.
However, the aircraft was not pulled to the airport’s apron until 8:30 p.m. on the day as technical staff had to elevate the plane to replace its blown-out tyre and conduct other checks.
The incident affected hundreds of flights to and from the airport.
According to a captain who is a flight instructor, similar landing incidents have occurred during bad weather conditions such as heavy rain and strong winds.
The captain explained that the pilot could have been unable to control the plane in the right direction due to the heavy downpour and tailwind, leading to it sliding off the runway.
Moreover, if the pilot suddenly hits the brakes, it could cause possible damage to the nose gear and the plane can skid off the runway as a result.
Early this morning, the plane was towed away from the scene of the incident.

Solar eclipse next week to be visible in Vietnam.
Vietnam will see part of an annular eclipse, commonly referred to as a "ring of fire," on June 21.
People in Hanoi can see 71 percent of the eclipse and those in Ho Chi Minh City, 36 percent.
The eclipse will begin in Vietnam at 1:16 p.m.

The second, a total eclipse on December 14, will be visible from South America.
A solar eclipse occurs when the disk of the moon appears to cross in front of the disk of the sun.
An annular eclipse occurs when the sun appears as a bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the moon.
The last solar eclipse seen in Vietnam was an annular eclipse on December 26 last year.
Scientists have sounded the warning: sky watchers should only see the eclipse indirectly or with proper glasses to prevent retinal burns.
HCMC hires private firm to build 372 ASEAN standard restrooms.
A private company has struck deals to build and maintain 372 restrooms of ASEAN Public Toilet Standards at many public spots in HCMC.
In return for its investment, estimated at around VND500 million ($21,500) for each facility, the company will be allowed to set up and run a convenience store in the vicinity.
Agreements to this effect have been reached between district authorities and the city-based Tien Phong Tech JSC.
Of the total, 283 restrooms will be established at spots chosen by districts, and 89 at bus stations.
So far, several restrooms of this type have been set up on a pilot basis around the city, including one at the corner of Tu Xuong and Cach Mang Thang Tam streets in District 3.
The restroom is a stainless steel affair with doors that open by pressing a button and close automatically after the user has entered the cabin.
Inside it is equipped with soap, hand sanitizer, and hand dryer, all designed to operate automatically.
One cabin covers a floor area of 70 square meters.
The investor is allowed to open a booth to sell convenience goods next to the restroom to recover the investment capital.
The restrooms are designed and produced exclusively by Tien Phong Tech.
The surrounding areas of the toilet should be kept clean, safe and provide easy access for visitors, and the exterior and interior design can either use traditional or modern architecture.
Each facility should have at least one toilet for the disabled with bigger doors for wheel chair access and railings for support.
HCMC has assigned district-level authorities to approve private investments in public toilets and cut the time taken for processing it.
Last month, the municipal environment department issued a guidance document saying that the authorities will provide land plots for the investors to set up public restrooms, and in return, the investors will be allowed to run certain services alongside to recover their investment.

Vietnam begins importing live pigs from Thailand.
Vietnam has given the green light for the import of pigs from Thailand for the purposes of both farming and slaughter from June 12 to bring down domestic pork prices that have skyrocketed due to the scarcity caused by the African swine fever epidemic.
Thailand was chosen as the supplier as its wholesale prices of hogs currently range between VND55,000 and VND60,000 per kilo, lower than Vietnam’s current prices averaging VND95,000 per kilogram.
Pham Tran Sum, director of Viet Duc International Nutrition Company, informed Nguoi Lao Dong Online that the firm is finalizing dossiers for the import of pigs for slaughter in Vietnam and is expected to receive the first batch of 2,000 pigs early next week.
Following the information, local pig prices dropped slightly to VND86,000 to VND87,000 per kilo.
When Thai pork is launched in the market, domestic prices may fall to below VND85,000 a kilo, Sum noted.
On June 11, Agriculture and Rural Development Deputy Minister Phung Duc Tien tasked the Animal Health Department with issuing detailed guidelines on quarantine measures for the imported pigs in line with existing regulations to prevent diseases and ensure the safety of domestic herds.
The department director is also responsible for ensuring coordination with inter-sector agencies at ports of entry and local authorities to strictly manage the live imports.

VinFast opens office in Australia.
Vietnamese carmaker VinFast has entered the Australian market by opening a research and development center in Melbourne on June 11 as part of its strategic plan to go global.
VinFast Australia is located next to Melbourne’s Financial and Economic Center and Monash University, in addition to many large-scale research facilities.
Such a prime location is convenient for research development and business activities.
The Australia-based office will research and develop new automobile models including gasoline-driven and electric cars, as well as lay the foundation for the carmaker’s global expansion, realizing its goal to become a global car brand by connecting with leading suppliers.
The new office employs some one hundred official employees, who are high-profile experts and engineers from the world's leading automobile corporations such as GM, Toyota, Ford and Jaguar Land Rover.
Being considered a “headquarters” of many major car manufacturers including Toyota, Ford, Mitsubishi and GM, Melbourne has several existing facilities, supply chains and manpower with a wealth of experience in the automobile industry.
VinFast, a subsidiary of Vietnamese conglomerate Vingroup, tested its first electric car in the capital city of Hanoi late last month to prepare for the new model’s debut by the end of the year.
The carmaker is set to launch the new electric model at the Los Angeles Auto Show in the United States in November.
Virtual jokes, real consequences.
Last month, news about actor Tran Thanh taking drugs with some of his celebrity friends were simmering among Vietnamese netizens.
The information was posted on Facebook with screenshots of a conversation between a group of friends.
Several hours later, the "joke" post was removed after thousands of people had viewed it.
The actor, an accidental victim of online rumors, decided to meet the women responsible for the post, in the presence of his lawyer.
"I do not know you.
You made up a story and spread it on the Internet, that is intentionally wrong,"  Trấn Thành told the supposed culprits last week.
Tran Thanh is among dozens of Vietnamese celebrities suddenly faced with the hurdles of rumors and misinformation spread via social media.
Death hoaxes are some of the most popular tricks.
Two months ago, a Facebooker posted photos of model Truong My Nhan depicting a deadly traffic accident, causing netizens to think her dead.
In 2018, singer Nhat Kim Anh was said to be a drug addict and "sleep with every man in showbiz.".
Kim Anh had to ask local police to investigate the woman responsible for the rumor.
Celebrities are the first victims of news about themselves spread on the Internet, which can cause scandals and directly affect their commercial activities.
According to actor Tran Thanh, 10 companies he has collaborated with asked for an explanation last week after rumors about him using drugs made the virtual airwaves.
Two other brands halted negotiations over new advertising contracts.
How can they sign a contract if my reputation is ruined? It affects my life and family, Tran Thanh said.
Many artists have shared their frustration and worries, including actor Van Anh and his wife who were said to be divorced after faking their marriage.
In April, local government decided to slap fines on those who post false, slanderous or lurid content online.
A new decree regulates fines of between VND10-20 million ($434 - 868) for taking advantage of social networks to provide fake information, slander or insult agencies and organizations, and lower the honor or dignity of individuals.
Trấn Thành has asked his lawyer to consider suing those who made up the rumors and report the case to local police.
In 2015, Hanoi police apprehended Tran Thi Huong Giang, 37, residing in Ba Dinh District, after she created several Facebook accounts to post and share fake news on local celebrities, calling it "truth conveying.".
The truth is, about half of Hanoi and Saigon residents encounter fake news at least once a week, according to a survey by Indochina Research last year.
Many are concerned about the impact of misinformation on their daily lives.
Rumors about celebrities, spread with the speed of light on the Internet.
The women accusing actor Tran Thanh of sniffing cocaine on Facebook said they were making a joke and apologized.
Meanwhile, the person spreading rumors about singer Nhat Kim Anh tried to deny her actions, saying her account was hacked.
Tran Thanh is the first Vietnamese celeb to take legal action against those sharing rumors about his personal life, with support from colleagues, many of whom had previously chosen to keep silent.
Proposal to allow five days off for National Day holiday rejected.
Minister of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs Dao Ngoc Dung has given multiple reasons for rejecting a proposal to increase the number of days off to five for Vietnam's National Day holiday on September 2.
Minister Dung told the local media on the sidelines of the ongoing sitting of the 14th National Assembly on June 10 that even though the proposal is aimed at boosting the tourism sector, it is necessary to carefully consider other aspects and assess its impact.
This year, National Day is in the middle of the week, leading to a wide gap between the holiday and the weekend, he noted, adding that receiving compensation for the days off is unreasonable.
Over the past few months, as Vietnam adopted various Covid-19 prevention and control measures and issued the social distancing order, employees and students have had several weeks off.
It is now high time for the country to both prevent and fight the coronavirus and focus on getting the manufacturing sector back on track and recovering the labor market to foster economic growth.
The Government can only allow the two million public employees to take days off for the holiday, a trivial number compared with the 55 million active laborers.
If the prime minister passes the proposal, the tourism sector will not see significant benefits, said Minister Dung.
Apart from this, between September 3 and 5, students normally start their new academic year.
For these reasons, the ministry and I have objected to the proposal to allow five days off for the upcoming national day holiday.
I had discussed the proposal with the prime minister and he agreed with my opinion, said Minister Dung.
Tourism authorities had previously proposed that the Government extend the National Day holiday on September 2 by four days to stimulate the tourism sector after Covid-19.

Butterflies taste with their feet.
A butterfly's sense of taste is coordinated by chemoreceptors on the tarsi, which work only on contact, and are used to determine whether an egg-laying insect's offspring will be able to feed on a leaf before eggs are laid on it.
They have taste sensors on their feet, and by standing on a leaf, they can taste it to see if their caterpillars can eat it.
Most adult butterflies can't bite or chew.
They eat mainly liquids like nectar, sap, juices from fruits, etc.
The blue whale's whistle is the loudest noise!
Blue whales mostly emit very loud, highly structured, repetitive low-frequency rumbling sounds that can travel for many miles underwater.
These songs may be used for communicating with other blue whales, especially in order to attract and find mates.
The call of the blue whale reaches levels up to 188 decibels.
This extraordinarily loud whistle can be heard for hundreds of miles underwater.
Theoretical calculations by Roger Payne and Douglas Webb (from the 1970′s) predicted that the loudest whale sounds might be transmitted across an entire ocean.
The blue whale is much louder than a jet, which reaches only 140 decibels! Human shouting is 70 decibels. sounds over 120 decibels are painful to human ears.
Mosquitoes are attracted to the color blue twice as much as to any other colors.
There are two kinds of Pandas.
Did you know there are two kinds of panda? There is a long-tailed Himalayan carnivore that looks like a raccoon and there is a giant panda bear that lives in Western China.
Slug have four noses.
Although they don't have the same type ofrespiratory system that the humanbeing has so their nose performs a different function to ours.
But they do have appendages that can sense heat and other stimuli, in other words they have 4 sensory organs where there nose looks like it should be.
But no actual nose.
Russian pilot falls into cliff when paragliding in Yen Bai.
A Russian pilot has met with an accident and fallen into the cliff from the height of 20 meters when joining the 2020 paragliding festival held in Mu Cang Chai District in the northwestern province of Yen Bai.
A grassroots officer of Mu Cang Chai's Cao Pha Commune confirmed on June 2 that the accident happened on May 30, the local media reported.
After a few seconds of taking off, the male pilot's paraglider teetered and fell into the cliff.
The leader of Cao Pha Commune said that the pilot flew the paraglider in a wrong way, leading to the unexpected fall.
The victim sustained minor back injury in the accident and is receiving treatment at Viet Duc Hospital in Hanoi City.
The paragliding festival taking place on Saturdays and Sundays from May 30 to July 15 is aimed at introducing tourism images of Yen Bai.
Local gasoline price could rise sharply tomorrow.
Local fuel wholesalers forecast that the gasoline price in the local market will rise some VND1,000 per liter tomorrow, June 12, following an upsurge in global petrol prices over the last 15 days.
Data from the Ministry of Industry and Trade revealed that the prices of RON92 and RON95 gasoline traded in Singapore's market as of June 8 were US$39.25 and US$42.16 per barrel, respectively, both up 19% against the previous 15-day period.
Oil prices also soared to US$42 per barrel.
A fuel merchant in HCMC said that local fuel traders have been suffering losses since their commission was sharply reduced, while the global fuel prices have been seeing an upward trend these days.
Accordingly, local fuel prices may be revised upward in line with the global market price.
Based on the global increment level, oil and gasoline prices in the local market are expected to edge up by VND800-VND1,000 per liter if the national fuel stabilization fund is untapped, the merchant said.
A representative of a fuel firm in Hanoi said that tomorrow will possibly mark the third consecutive time that local fuel prices are set to rise sharply since April 28.
He predicted that local oil and petrol prices will edge up some VND500-VND600 per liter.
Bulgarian jailed for stealing bank account data.
Stamov Ruslan Todorvo, 37, entered Vietnam last October and stayed in Ho Chi Minh City's District 7.
He frequented several ATMs of different banks to install a device which could collect PIN numbers and other card information, allowing him to collect bank card numbers when someone used an ATM, local media reported.
From October 7 to October 11 last year, several banks found that some of their customers' accounts had been compromised and the money withdrawn from different ATMs in the city.
Investigating police found that Todorvo was part of a Bulgarian group who had been stealing bank card information and using it to steal money with fake ATM cards that they made with another device.
Todorvo was detained October 10 when he went to the Tan Son Nhat Airport to leave Vietnam.
Police found that his laptop contained data from 121 bank accounts, including 98 from Vietnamese banks and the rest from outside the country.
According to info provided by several banks, at least 10 customers have been robbed off around VND87.5 million ($3,780) in total.
Their account information was found in Todorvo's laptop.
He denied accusations that he had stolen the money.
No information on other members in his group has been revealed.
Cancer-causing Ingredient in Chili Peppers Soothed by Ginger.
It's widely thought that ginger has health benefits — one of which may be to protect against an ingredient in chili peppers that has been linked to stomach cancer.
Both ginger and chili peppers are commonly used in Asian cuisine.
Chili peppers get their kick from capsaicin, which some research suggests also has plenty of health benefits.
But a diet rich in capsaicin has also been linked to stomach cancer.
Now, new research shows that one compound in ginger appears to offset the negative health effects of the chili pepper ingredient, and that used together, the two compounds might actually inhibit cancer growth.
Researchers at Pharmacy College of Henan University in China conducted a study with mice prone to lung cancer.
Over the course of several weeks, they fed the mice either capsaicin or 6-gingerol or both.
China surprises economists with GDP rise of 7%.
Following weeks of stock market turmoil, China has confounded expectations that its economic growth would slow further in the second quarter, with gross domestic product rising by 7%.
Analysts had widely predicted that economic growth would dip from 7% in the first quarter to around 6.8% in the second.
However, GDP held steady, officials from China's National Bureau of Statistics claimed on Wednesday morning.
The figure still represents the lowest level of growth since the 2009 global financial crisis but is in line with Beijing's official target for 2015 of around 7%.
The announcement of stable second quarter growth surprised analysts, offered a boost to Beijing's attempts to soften the country's economic slowdown and came after weeks of chaos in the Chinese stock market which saw more than $3tn wiped off shares.
However, there were immediate doubts over the growth figure's reliability with the announcement sparking renewed debate over the trustworthiness of Beijing's statistics.

Bkav to launch low-cost cell phones.
Local Internet security firm Bkav on June 10 announced its plan to manufacture low-cost mobile phones priced at less than VND1 million.
The production of the Bkav Smart Feature Phone 4G-C85 is aimed at supplying the local market with cell phones with 4G Internet connections at affordable prices.

The firm's cooperation with the telecom carrier is expected to expand its manufacturing operations to serve various customers, he added.
he noted, Bkav has been selling mid- and high-end products, so it is about time the firm entered into the low-cost cell phone segment.
Illegal hormone supply places transgender Vietnamese at risk.
To An has spent the last decade reliant on feminizing hormones smuggled to Vietnam after her gender reassignment surgery (GRS).
I consulted several hospitals in Saigon, but was rejected due to a lack of professionalism.
I was stuck and considered suicide, To An recalled.
In 2009, a gay man from Thailand told her about a medicine that could give users smoother skin, develop their breasts, and stop facial hair from growing.
After receiving her order, To An asked a friend to help her with the injection, not considering the side effects.
According to the Center for Supporting Community Development Initiatives (SCDI), there are around 300,000 to 500,000 transgender Vietnamese, with 70 percent using hormones purchased from acquaintances, the Internet, or, like To An, the black market.
There is no pharmacy or medical facility providing hormone therapy to transgender Vietnamese, who have to rely on unprescribed hormones that often cause a host of side-effects.
Most miracle effect testosterone and estrogen hormones are imported illegally from Thailand, Germany, and India, their origins completely unknown.
In the past three months, the Covid-19 pandemic has seen international flights to Vietnam halted, leaving transgender Vietnamese in the lurch.
According to To An, many of her friends, who seldom stockpile hormones, are currently reliant on birth control pills.
The lack of supply is only one dilemma.
For many years, To An's friends have helped her inject hormones, mostly on a trial-and-error basis.
Once, following an injection in her buttock that caught infection, she had to be rushed to hospital for life-saving surgery, leaving her body permanently scarred.
After a near bleed-out, Truc Quan, 21, has been self-injecting estrogen bought online for eight months, extremely conscious of the many risks involved.
According to Doctor Nguyen Van Phung, plastic surgery lecturer at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam has no laws governing hormone therapy or GRS for its transgender populace.
Common side-effects of hormone injection include embolism, osteoporosis, hypertension, and allergy.
Using unprescribed medication can be even more dangerous.
If facing complications related to hormone treatment or GRS, transgender citizens should immediately attend hospital, the doctor stressed.
Quan, having learnt her lesson, now periodically visits a clinic to receive a hormone injection.
she said, I hope my friends learn about the side-effects of hormone treatment, find a doctor, or someone with a medical background to assist them.

National Day holiday extension proposed as tourism boost.
The Vietnam National Administration of Tourism (VNAT) has suggested that this year's National Day holiday in September be extended from Wednesday to the weekend.
This year, the national holiday falls on a Wednesday, and many localities and over 30 businesses have said the holiday could be extended for the rest of that week to commemorate the 75th National Day and promote domestic tourism, VNAT head Nguyen Trung Khanh said on Tuesday.
Ha Tat Thang, head of the Department of Labor Safety, which is an advisory agency for annual holidays under the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, said he has not received any official document with such a suggestion from the tourism sector.
Recovering from the epidemic, all businesses want to focus on restoring production.
Each sector will have its own direction, but everything should serve the same interest, he said, adding that he would discuss the proposal with the labor ministry once he receives an official document.
Whether the holiday would be extended or not would be decided by the government, he said.
Of a total of 14 public holidays in Vietnam this year, there's only one left, which is the National Day.
Starting 2021, Vietnamese will enjoy an extra day off for the National Day holiday, either on September 1 or September 3.

The heat wave is forecast to linger until June 13 and may become the longest to have hit northern Vietnam since 1993.
Nguyen Van Huong, head of the weather forecasting department at the center, said widespread heat waves since 1993 had only lasted five to seven days.
The average temperatures in northern localities in the coming days are expected to reach 36 to 39 degrees Celsius.
American forecast services provider AccuWeather said the temperature in Hanoi would reach 38 degrees Celsius and remains at 35-36 until this weekend.
At 1 p.m Monday, all monitoring stations recorded temperatures above 37 with a scorching hot sun.
The highest is Lang area at 39, Ha Dong District at 38.5, Hoai Duc and Son Tay Districts at 38.
The heat wave was caused by low-pressure areas from the west and the Foehn wind, a type of dry, warm and down-slope wind that occurs in the lee of a mountain range, Huong said.
Experts have advised residents to avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 10 a.m and 3 p.m and to wear sunscreen, sunglasses and brimmed hats if venturing out under the sun.
Central Vietnam has been impacted by similar scorching weather over the past 10 days.
The heat is expected to continue in the region until June 16.
It is quite common for a heat wave to last 17 to 18 days in central Vietnam.
The most intense heat wave to have struck the region occurred in 2015, lasting for up to 39 days.
The National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting has warned of high risks of fire and explosion at local residential areas and forests due to the hot and dry weather.
Vietnam has been going through scorching days since early May.
On May 21, Hanoi's Ha Dong District experienced a record 40.9 degrees Celsius, the highest May temperature since 1961.
On the same day, parts of Lao Cai, Hoa Binh and Ha Giang also recorded their highest May temperatures in decades.

The nation broke its highest temperature record on April 20 as the mercury hit 43.4 degrees Celsius, or 110 degrees Fahrenheit, in Huong Khe District, Ha Tinh Province in central Vietnam.
Vietnam could host AFF Cup on its own.
Vietnam could end up hosting the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Cup 2020 on its own thanks to its effective handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) General Secretary Le Hoai Anh affirmed last weekend that a single host was one of the options being considered by the AFF.
In an official announcement last week, the ASEAN federation affirmed that it won't be postponing the championship until 2021 as earlier planned, and the tournament will take place from November 25 to December 31, soon after the World Cup 2022 qualifiers.
The AFF Cup had introduced the new format of having home and away matches for each team from the group stage to the final in 2018.
Anh said Vietnam has not received any official notice from the AFF about changing the tournament format, but added that anything can happen in the current situation.
If the AFF Cup opts to have the tournament played in just one country, Vietnam stands a great chance to host it because it would be considered a safe location after its demonstrated success in containing the pandemic.
Vietnam is the only country in Southeast Asia to have restarted its football tournaments and opened up stadiums for spectators.
The National Cup commenced May 23, making it the first football tournament to make a comeback after Vietnam eased its social distancing campaigns late April.
The match between Duoc Nam Ha Nam Dinh (Nam Dinh FC) and Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAGL FC) saw 10,000 spectators fill half of the Thien Truong Stadium in Nam Dinh Province, an event that made international headlines.

Vietnamese pop singers are interested in traditional topics.
Vietnamese pop singers are broaching traditional topics in a brave new way, sparking off lively debates.
The two most notable recent songs are by Hoa Minzy and Bich Phuong.
Hoa Minzy's ambitious nine-minute ballad musical video titled Khong The Cung Nhau Suot Kiep (Can't Be Together Forever) provides a glimpse into the historical, gender-charged love story between Vietnam's last emperor, Bao Dai, and his wife, Empress Nam Phuong.
Nam Phuong was wedded to Bao Dai in an unprecedented marriage which required but didn't receive permission from the Roman Catholic Church because she was a Catholic and he was not.
She was consecrated as empress or the emperor's first wife right away, a patriarchal honor rarely bestowed on the concubines of the Nguyen Dynasty.
Nam Phuong went on to have five children with her husband.
Bao Dai, however, had other wives as well as extramarital affairs.
It is Nam Phuong's reaction upon discovering her husband's change of heart that is artistically treated in Hoa Minzy's MV.
Released on YouTube on May 13, Không Thể Cùng Nhau Suốt Kiếp has been widely lauded for its meticulous directing and scripting.
Within three days the MV went on to become the No.1 clip on YouTube Vietnam's Top Trending after attracting over 10 million views.
It has now garnered over 22 million views, many more likes than dislikes, and a lot of positive comments.
Hoang Thuy Linh has a bunch of EDM songs that make creative use of Vietnamese culture such as her 2019 hit De Mi Noi Cho Ma Nghe (Let Mi Tell You), which was inspired by 20th-century writer To Hoai's short story Vo Chong A Phu (A Phu and His Wife) about a couple living in the northwestern mountains during the French resistance.
Many MVs find inspiration in Vietnamese history, literature and folk culture has become a clever strategy for Vietnamese singers.

Fruit exporters hit by rising air freight costs.
Vietnamese fruit exporters are struggling since air freight costs are surging due to the limited number of flights amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Global Fresh Fruit Company Ltd of Ben Tre Province has seen exports fall by half in the last two months despite high demand from overseas buyers.
Its CEO, Phung Van Hien, said logistics companies are demanding two to four times the freight they did at the end of 2019.
Rates for shipping to the Middle East have surged from $1.5-1.8 per kilogram to $6, and freight to Australia has also increased, he said.

British Covid-19 patient is fully conscious.
Vietnam's most severe case of Covid-19, the 91st patient, is fully conscious and able to respond to all instructions from health workers, said a representative from HCMC's Cho Ray Hospital, where the patient is being treated.
The British patient, who works as a pilot for the national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, smiled when health workers were interacting with him.
He could also feebly nod and shake the hands of the health workers, the hospital representative said at 7 p.m on June 2.
According to doctors at the hospital, his respiratory functions have gradually improved, while his kidney functions have also recovered.
His blood oxygen level remains stable.
The doctors have weaned him off an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine for two days, which is a life support machine used when a patient's heart and lungs fail to function properly.
However, he has to rely on a ventilator.
As for the patient's lungs, more than half of his left lung has almost recovered, while the right lung is showing signs of improvement.
The hospital representative said that the patient would continue to take antibiotics to treat his infection from Burkholderia cenocepacia, a type of bacteria, as well as to prevent other bacterial infections.

Vietnam launches second mobile virtual network operator.
A second mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) called Reddi was introduced to the local market on June 3 by operator Mobicast, with the 055 prefix.
The network will use the mobile phone infrastructure of the State-owned Vietnam Post and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) to offer services to its customers.
To date, there are five traditional mobile network carriers in the country, namely Viettel, MobiFone, VNPT, Vietnamobile and Gtel.
As the latest addition to the local mobile network market, Reddi stressed that it would target young and modern customers and offer them telecom and digital services through mobile apps.
Reddi will not offer services at competitive prices but will focus on the customer experience.
The operator Mobicast noted that it would coordinate with digital service providers to offer Reddi customers new and personalized technology services.
One year ago, the country's first mobile virtual network called ITelecom was introduced with the numeral prefix 087.
At the launch ceremony, its operator Dong Duong Telecom Company said ITelecom would tap the niche market and provide mobile network services to workers in industrial zones.
However, ITelecom has not released its business performance results since the launch.
Data from the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications revealed that there are some 126 million mobile subscriptions in Vietnam but the average revenue earned from each subscription remains low at some VND100,000 per month.
Accordingly, experts in the field said the current fierce competitive market does not leave much room for mobile virtual networks to grow.
Le Dang Dung, chairman of military-run telecom carrier Viettel, told the Saigon Times that MVNOs see success only in European countries where the average revenue generated from each mobile subscription is high.
In Vietnam, MVNOs will struggle to compete with existing traditional mobile network operators since the average expenditures on mobile services in Vietnam are already low at VND70,000-VND90,000 per month.
Moreover, MVNOs can only survive when traditional mobile network carriers have yet to own widespread sales channels.
In reality, local telecom carriers have established their business operations nationwide with a large number of both offline and online stores, he added.
MPS steps up investigation into bribery case at Tenma.
The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) has ordered the Bac Ninh Province police to work with Japanese firm Tenma in the investigation of a bribery scandal involving 25 million yen to escape tax duties.
Speaking at a regular Government press briefing on June 2, Major General To An Xo, head of the office of the ministry, said that the prime minister had directed the Ministries of Finance and Public Security to launch a thorough probe into the case.
While the investigation is being conducted by the Ministry of Finance, the MPS has asked the Bac Ninh police to verify the information and collect the relevant paperwork and documentary evidence, Xo said.
The ministry also requested several relevant agencies to contact the Japanese firm over paperwork related to the case, the local media reported.
Under the prime minister's directive, investigation into the bribery case must be conducted in a transparent manner to prevent tax losses, noted the major general.
Earlier, several Japanese media outlets including Asahi, Kyodo and Nikkei had reported that Vietnamese officials accepted 25 million yen or VND5 billion in bribes from the Vietnam unit of the Tokyo-based company.
Minister of Finance Dinh Tien Dung on May 26 ordered the suspension of tax and customs officials implicated in the bribery case involving Tenma Vietnam, a subsidiary of Japan's plastic product maker Tenma Corporation, leading to 11 officials being suspended for 15 days pending the probe.
Late disbursement said to be reason for Chinese contractor's capital demand.
The Chinese contractor stated that the late disbursement of funds in the Cat Linh-Ha Dong railway project prompted it to demand US$50 million to pay the subcontractors and experts.
On June 3, Tang Hong, director of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong metro project, said that since February, the capital disbursement for the project was yet to be done, hindering the Chinese contractor from paying the subcontractors.
While most of the project equipment has been completed, Hong noted that the payment for the workload was yet to be made, VnExpress news site reported.
The Chinese contractor asked the Railway Project Management Unit to pay US$50 million, in line with the provisions of the contract at an online meeting in May so that it could make payments to contractors, subcontractors and experts while operating the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway on a trial basis.
This is the payment for the construction workload in accordance with the engineering, procurement and construction contract but not the increased costs, Hong said.
Meanwhile, Vu Hong Phuong, director of the Railway Project Management Unit, said that the documents sent to the unit by the Chinese contractor were not eligible, so the unit could not make any payment.
Lower growth trend brews for Vietnam beer industry.
Vietnam's strict implementation of drunk driving laws and other factors will dampen the beer market this year.
A recent report by the Vietnam Industry Research And Consultancy (VIRAC) says this will be a trend in coming years despite the fact that a million people become newly eligible to consume alcohol each year.
The report estimates an annual growth of 6-7 percent for the domestic beer industry.
It notes that the industry's stock value dropped by nearly 13 percent last year and says small businesses are likely to be most affected by the drop in growth.
In 2019, Vietnam consumed more than 4.6 billion liters of beer, an increase of more than 10 percent over the previous year.
According to Germany-based data portal Statista, beer sales revenue rose 6.88 percent year-on-year to around $7.75 billion.
The main reason for the industry slump is Decree 100, which took effect on January 1 this year, imposing stiff penalties for drunk driving.
Those riding bicycles and electric bikes will also be fined for this.
Motorcyclists and car drivers can be fined VND6-8 million and VND30-40 million ($1,300-1,725), double the old levels and have their licenses suspended for 22-24 months.
Covid-19 pandemic is also said to likely contribute to slower growth this year.
The reports noted that Vietnam's export markets, including China and Southeast Asian countries, are experiencing high growth in food and beverage consumption.
Equatorial Guinea in Africa is Vietnam's biggest export market, accounting for 20 percent.
Vietnam's export beer output in 2019 is estimated at 46 million liters valued at $45.87 million.
Big C Mien Dong to close down.
Thailand's Central Retail, which manages and operates the Big C supermarket chain in Vietnam, announced yesterday that it will shut down the Big C Mien Dong in HCMC's District 10 in the next 20 days, as it has failed to reach an agreement on the site lease with the landlord.
Given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the Thai retailer has made efforts to reach an agreement over the extension of the contract with the site lessor to maintain normal operations at the supermarket and support local consumers during the post-Covid-19 period, according to a Central Retail representative.
However, new suggestions from the lessor over the contract extension have left the retailer unable to fulfill its commitment to offer products at low prices to consumers, following which it decided to cease operating the supermarket.
After the shutdown, employees of Big C Mien Dong will continue to work at other Big C stores, the representative added.
Aside from Big C Mien Dong, other Big C supermarkets under the Central Retail Vietnam in HCMC include Big C Truong Chinh, Big C Au Co, Big C Phu Thanh, Big C An Phu and GO! Market.
The Thai retailer said that it will adopt measures to minimize the inconveniences caused to the loyal customers of Big C Mien Dong by continuously offering them shopping and direct-to-site delivery services via the hotline 1900 1880 or through online shopping apps such as Chopp and GrabMart.
Big C Mien Dong, which is located on To Hien Thanh Street, is among the first Big C supermarkets that French retailer Casino launched in the local market in 2003.
Big C was then rebranded as Cora following an M&A deal between two French retailers.
From 2016 onward, the Big C Vietnam supermarket chain was officially owned by Thailand's Central Group.

British Covid-19 patient smiles after two months in coma.
A British man who is Vietnam's most critical Covid-19 patient so far smiled as doctors talked to him on Tuesday.
The Covid-19 treatment sub-committee under the Health Ministry said his smile carries a lot of meaning, showing that he has been more conscious.
The digestive system of the patient, a 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot designated as patient 91, has also improved as his abdominal distension has reduced.
His kidney functions have recovered and he has been able to move his hands and legs.
The patient has developed a stronger cough reflex.
His pulmonary ventilation has become more stable.
However, he still has to rely on the life support extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) system.
The blood flowing through his ECMO currently stays at 3.7 liters per minute, and doctors are working to gradually reduce the system's oxygen flow to 1.5 liters per minute.
Previously, while he was still in a severely critical condition, the oxygen flow could go up to 5.7 liters per minute.
On Monday, doctors at the Cho Ray Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City where the patient is treated have started letting him have physical therapy twice a day.
Tran Thanh Linh, deputy head of the emergency department at the hospital, said an X-ray image of his lungs on May 25 revealed tissue or fluid blocking blood vessels in both lungs but the one taken on Tuesday showed that more than half of the left lung has recovered from such situation.
His muscle weakness has also been improved.
This is the right time to reduce his dependence on the ECMO, he said.
Earlier, the patient had suffered from the cytokine storm syndrome, which happened when his immune system overreacted to the novel coronavirus attacking the body, releasing too many cytokines, damaging his organs.
For now, he is still infected with Burkholderia cenocepacia, a type of opportunistic bacteria, and doctors said it is difficult to treat.
Vietnam has recorded 328 Covid-19 cases so far.
Vietnam passport ranks low in global ranking.
Vietnam is one of the least powerful passports in the world, ranking 157th among 199, says a report released Tuesday by Nomad Capitalist.
The global offshore consulting firm ranked 199 economies in terms of passport strength based on five categories. visa-free travel, international taxation laws, global perception, dual citizenship and personal freedom.
Vietnam's low ranking in the Nomad Passport Index 2020 reflects the fact that Vietnamese passport holders can only travel visa-free to 54 countries and territories, slightly more than Laos in Southeast Asia with 50, the Hong Kong-based firm said.
Vietnam also scored poorly in terms of global perception and level of personal freedom of citizens, travelers and expats, the report said.
In Southeast Asia, Singapore has the most powerful passport with visa free access to 190 destinations and a high level of personal freedom, followed by Malaysia with 178 countries.
Nine of the ten top passports were from Europe, with Singapore being the only non-European country to break into the top ten.
The Swedish passport was the most powerful with visa-free access to 186 countries and territories, high levels of personal freedom and an excellent global reputation.
The worst passport was from Afghanistan, with visa free access to just 26 destinations.
With the Donald Trump administration pursuing a hostile immigration policy, the U.S lost its throne as the most powerful passport in the world, slipping down to 40th rank.
According to Mastercard, Vietnam has the second fastest growing outbound market in the Asia Pacific region after Myanmar, with projected annual growth of 9.5 percent between 2016 and 2021.
The firm forecast some 7.5 million Vietnamese travelers would venture outside the country in 2021.

Deputy Minister of Transport Nguyen Ngoc Dong stated that the Chinese contractor's demand of US$50 million for the trial operation of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi City would not be considered by the Ministry of Transport as it goes against the provisions of the contract.
Stressing that the demand was not made in an official document, the deputy minister told the local media on June 2 that the Chinese side demanded US$50 million for the trial operation of the railway during certain online meetings held between them and the Railway Project Management Unit.
The payments for the railway project have been made by the Vietnamese side in accordance with the regulations of the engineering procurement and construction contract, the deputy minister noted.
In case the Chinese contractor sends a document requesting the capital, the demand will not be considered as it goes against the contract, Dong added.
Under the contract, even if the Chinese contractor suffers from financial difficulties during this time, they will have to run a trial operation, Dong remarked, adding that the Vietnamese side will not bear responsibility for any additional payment.

Vietnamese fabric exports excluded from Indonesia's new tariffs.
Indonesia's Ministry of Finance has imposed new tariffs on imports, effective from May to November 2022, to protect its local manufacturers due to the rising imports of fabric, fibers, and curtains, but Vietnamese fabric being imported into Indonesia is not subject to the new taxes.
Under the Indonesian ministry's Decree 56/2020, the levels of self-defense taxes are at 1,405 rupiah or US$0.93 per kilogram from May 27 to November 8, at 1,193 rupiah per kilogram from November 9 to November 8, 2021 and at 979 rupiah per kilogram from November 9, 2021, to November 8, 2022, according to VietnamPlus news site.
Several countries and territories, including Hong Kong and South Korea, are exempted from the new tariffs on synthetic fibers and curtains, while the fabric exports from India and Vietnam to Indonesia are not affected by the new taxes.
Last year, the Indonesian Government imposed temporary duties of up to 67.7% on textile and garment imports to protect its locally manufactured products and encourage domestic consumption.
Moody's has warned that the U.S.-Sino trade tensions will possibly prompt a shift in fabric, fibers and apparel products from China to Southeast Asia including Indonesia, hindering the stability of demand and supply and hurting local producers.
The United States has levied a 25% import tax on China's textiles and garments, higher than the levels of 10-15% being applied by Indonesia.

Chinese contractor demands US$50m for system operation of Cat Linh-Ha Dong project.
While the completion date of the Cat Linh-Ha Dong urban railway project in Hanoi is not yet known and the inspection dossiers have not been completed, Chinese contractor China Railway 6 Bureau Group has requested US$50 million for the system operation before handing over the project.

According to the Government, the completion date for the project has not yet been decided and the responsibilities of organizations and individuals for the slow progress have not been made clear. so, capital has not been allocated for the construction supervision package.
To address these obstacles, the Railway Project Management Unit suggested that the Ministry of Transport report the problems to the Government for solutions, extend the construction supervision package, and organize meetings with the Chinese contractor to discuss capital demand for the trial operation of the railway.

Trump on Friday pledged to take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory, and to impose sanctions on unspecified individuals over Beijing's new laws on the Asian financial centre.

Details of the laws remain unclear, even to Hong Kong officials, but are expected to be enacted by China's parliament this summer.

VinFast on Thursday tested its first electric car model in Hanoi in preparation for Los Angeles Auto Show in November.
Although the company does not release sales figures, official data shows 5,124 VinFast cars were registered in the first quarter, helping the auto brand rank fifth in Vietnam sales.
VinSmart has sold 1.2 million smartphones in 17 months to claim third place in Vietnam market share behind South Korea's Samsung and China's Oppo.
However, losses are expected for both companies in three to five years, Vuong warned.
For the next several years our target is not to profit but to dominate the market.
Vingroup, with a market cap of over $14 billion, has not been immune to coronavirus impacts.
The board has announced that it would strictly manage spending and investment this year to reduce costs and focus on developing its existing businesses.
The company aims to hit a revenue of VND145 trillion ($6.2 billion) this year, up 12 percent over 2019, and a post-tax profit of VND5 trillion ($214 million), down 35 percent.
Hanoi jails man who tricked two women into prostitution in China.
A man was sentenced to 19 years in jail Wednesday for his involvement in trafficking two women to China in 2005.
Dinh Van Dong, 52, was charged with human trafficking and trafficking of a person under 16, the Hanoi People's Court heard.
In 2005, Dong lent Nguyen Thi Thu Ha, 36, a certain amount of money to help her mother pay off a debt.
In return, Ha had to coerce two women from Hanoi to sell commodities in China on Dong's behalf, local media reported.
Visiting Hanoi in May 2005, Ha met a woman named Hang who helped her persuade two anonymous sisters, one aged under 16, to travel to China.
However, both sisters were subsequently sold into prostitution, earning Dong VND3 million ($128), and Ha and Hang VND14 million ($599).
Police opened an investigation after the sisters' parents reported that they went missing.
They soon arrested Ha, who in February 2006 was sentenced to 17 years in jail on the charges of human trafficking and trafficking of a person under 16.
Dong was arrested in September last year.
Hang's whereabouts remain unknown.
The sisters have not been rescued.
Vietnam is a human trafficking and illegal migration hotspot with annual profits worth tens of billions of dollars, according to the Ministry of Public Security.
The country has recorded over 3,400 victims of human trafficking since 2013, over 90 percent of them women, children and people from ethnic minority communities, Nguyen Xuan Lap, head of the ministry's Department of Social Issues Prevention, said at a conference in November last year.
VinFast test runs electric car for launch at US show.
Automaker VinFast has tested its first electric car model in Hanoi with plans to introduce it in a U.S auto show later this year.
VinFast plans to launch the car at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November before promoting it in different countries in January next year.
It plans to start mass production in July next year.
The car is designed by Italy's Pininfarina, which also designed VinFast's first SUV and sedan.
The car is set to have a 470 horsepower engine and be able to run 500 kilometers on full charge.
VinFast is developing its own batteries for the vehicle using cells from South Korea's LG company.
VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest company Vingroup, started delivering its first cars in June last year.
The company does not release sales figures, but official data shows that 5,124 VinFast cars were registered in the first quarter.
This puts it in the fifth place in sales, behind Hyundai, Toyota, Kia and Honda.
Coronavirus deaths in US top 100,000.
Health officials say the actual death toll is likely far higher than the recorded count.
The US has passed 100,000 deaths in the coronavirus outbreak in less than four months.
It has seen more fatalities than any other country, while its 1.69 million confirmed infections account for about 30% of the worldwide total.
The first US infection was reported in Washington state on 21 January.
Globally there have been 5.6 million people recorded as infected and 354,983 deaths since the virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
The US death toll stands at 100,276, according to Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, which has been tracking the pandemic.
It means that around as many Americans have died from Covid-19 than from the Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.
But on a per capita basis the US ranks ninth in its mortality rate behind the likes of Belgium, the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, according to the university.
British Covid-19 patient moves out of two-month coma.
Vietnam's most critically ill Covid-19 patient regained consciousness Wednesday after doctors reduced his sedation doses.
Patient 91, a 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot in Ho Chi Minh City, has started having cough responses, could move the tips of his fingers, make basic communication and follow doctors' simple instructions, said Doctor Nguyen Tri Thuc, director of Cho Ray Hospital.
Thuc said this development happened two days after doctors stopped using muscle relaxants on him and gradually reduced his sedation dosage.
His thoracic diaphragm and limbs, however, remained weak or paralyzed.
Doctors also stopped dialysis again after having restored the treatment for 24 hours.
The patient's condition is still severely critical, but his awareness, blood oxygen level and kidney functions have improved compared to two days earlier, the doctor said.
According to a treatment sub-committee set up by the Health Ministry, X-ray images of the patient's lungs Wednesday afternoon showed small improvement, and doctors have reduced the blood flow through the ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) system from 4.5 liters per minute last Friday to 4 liters per minute.
ECMO is a technique that pumps blood out of the body and to a heart-lung machine that removes carbon dioxide and sends oxygen-filled blood back.
While the patient's lung functions have shown improvements, these are still not enough, Thuc said.
He would still have to undergo treatment for his lung infection with the goal of gradually reducing his reliance on the ECMO system.
The patient is scheduled to have a third chest CT scan Thursday afternoon for an evaluation of his lung recovery.
The health ministry sub-committee, Cho Ray Hospital's doctors and experts from major hospitals across the country would hold an online consultation Friday to agree on the next treatment plan for the patient, a pilot employed by Vietnam Airlines at the time he was confirmed infected.
Earlier, the patient had suffered from the cytokine storm syndrome, which happened when his immune system overreacted to the novel coronavirus attacking the body, releasing too many cytokines, damaging his organs.
The Vietnam Airlines pilot was the first case in the cluster of infections in HCMC associated with the Buddha Bar & Grill, a major outbreak site in the southern metropolis.
A few days after he was diagnosed, 18 others were also found infected.
Chemical castration proposed against child sexual abusers.
A National Assembly (NA) deputy has recommended that chemical castration be one of the penalties for those found guilty of committing sex crimes on children.
According to NA deputy Nguyen Ngoc Phuong from Quang Binh Province, chemical castration has been adopted in many countries.
Chemical castration involves using a drug to lower the testosterone level in men, which affects their sex drive.
If Vietnam approves the addition to the law on fighting child sexual violence, the number of child abuse cases could drop by 50% in the years to come, Phuong stated during a discussion on adopting policies and laws to prevent and fight against child abuse, held on May 27.
Aside from chemical castration, the NA deputy of the central locality suggested further penalties for child sexual offenders, including increasing administrative fines, disclosing the identities of sexual offenders and listing their offenses in their CVs, to deter offenders and prevent recidivism as well as protect children.
Phuong added that child abuse has caused a public uproar.
Many people he has met have called for offenders to be arrested and punished strictly and promptly.
Most child abusers are acquaintances or even parents of the victims.
They take advantage of the children's innocence to commit these crimes.
Some have even repeated their offenses and threatened to kill the victims if they dare to report them, Phuong remarked, adding that it is essential for the NA to closely monitor for the prevention of and fight against child abuse.
He proposed the Government should study plans to increase or impose extra penalties on child sexual predators.
Commenting on the increase in fines and penalties, NA deputy Duong Minh Tuan from Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province noted that Vietnam's legal framework was not strong enough to protect children from all forms of violence, resulting in a rise in child abuse cases and leaving a significant impact on victims, both physically and mentally.
Accordingly, Tuan suggested imposing heavier fines and sanctions on offenders.
Data released at the discussion showed that the country had uncovered over 8,440 child abuse cases between January 2015 and June 2019, with more than 8,700 child victims.
During the first half of last year, up to 1,400 children were reported as victims in child abuse cases, which is equivalent to some 80% of the total crimes against children recorded in 2018.py.
Minister said, no foreign individuals own land in Vietnam.
Minister of Natural Resources and Environment Tran Hong Ha stressed that no foreign nationals have been granted certificates denoting prime land use rights in the country, adding that the ministry will soon introduce regulations curbing the practice of aliens using Vietnamese as fronts to acquire land lots in the country.
Ha told reporters on the sidelines of the National Assembly session on May 27 that in line with prevailing regulations, foreigners are not issued land use rights certificates.
The Land Law states that foreigners are not eligible to own land lots in Vietnam, so the granting of land use rights certificates to aliens is nonexistent.
However, the regulations allow the issuance of land use rights certificates to legal representatives of foreign firms and foreign-invested enterprises as firms are allowed to receive stake transfers and capital contributions in line with the Investment Law.
The ministry is completing a legal framework for land to clearly form groups of strategic land lots, especially those of significant importance to national defense, to launch special policies for the handover of land, land leases and the issuance of land use rights certificates,Tuoi Tre newspaper reported, citing Ha.
HCMC to open Can Gio-Vung Tau ferry service in September.
The ferry route linking HCMC's outlying district of Can Gio and neighboring Vung Tau City is expected to be launched on September 2.
Bui Hoa An, deputy director of the HCMC Department of Transport, noted that the 15-kilometer ferry route will be put into service in early September instead of early April due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Quoc Chanh Ltd will operate the ferry route, with a single trip expected to take 30 minutes.
Currently, travel between Can Gio and Vung Tau is only possible by road and takes over three hours and 30 minutes, Thanh Nien newspaper reported.
Ferries on the route can accommodate over 250 passengers, 100 motorcycles, and 15 cars or trucks, with 24 trips expected per day.
The ferry route will also benefit local people in Long An and Tien Giang provinces as it will take them only two hours and 30 minutes to travel to Vung Tau using the new waterway route compared with using the HCMC-Long Thanh-Dau Giay Expressway.
Aside from saving on travel time, ferry passengers can enjoy the scenery along Rung Sac Road and visit tourist sites in Can Gio.
An noted that Quoc Chanh has proposed a ferry ticket price of VND50,000 per trip.
However, the pricing must be reported to the municipal Department of Finance for consideration and then reported to the HCMC People's Council.
The ferry terminals are under construction, and work on some transporter bridges is complete, remarked the deputy director of the municipal department.
The Can Gio-Vung Tau ferry route, coupled with the existing routes for Binh Khanh and Can Gio-Can Giuoc, will create more favorable conditions for Can Gio to connect with its neighboring provinces, reduce traffic overload and contribute to HCMC's socioeconomic and tourism growth, he added.
Vietnam suspends officials implicated in Japanese firm's bribery allegations.
Several tax and customs officials in Bac Ninh Province will be suspended for 15 days pending investigations into bribery allegations made in Japan.
The decision was made at the request of Finance Minister Dinh Tien Dung to the General Department of Taxation and the General Customs Department Tuesday, following reports that a Japanese plastic company paid the officials $215,000 in bribes.
Members of the tax and customs teams that inspected imports by Tenma Vietnam, which has operated in the northern province since 2007, and senior officials responsible for setting up the two teams are subject to the suspension order.
Among the suspension list are the head of Bac Ninh's Customs Department and deputy head of the province's Tax Department.
On Monday, the finance ministry began probing recent reports in some Japanese newspapers, including Asahi, that Tenma had bribed Vietnamese officials on two occasions - in 2017 and last year.
An Asahi report said that Tenma representatives on April 1 confessed to prosecutors in Tokyo that its subsidiary Tenma Vietnam in June 2017 had imported a batch of molds and Vietnamese officials demanded a value-added tax of JPY1.8 billion ($16.7 million).
To avoid this obligation, the CEO of Tenma Vietnam, which is based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, paid a senior customs official VND2 billion (JPY10 million or about $86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August last year, Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma Vietnam to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, of JPY89 million ($826,400).
It said Tenma Vietnam paid VND3 billion (JPY15 million or around $129,000) in cash to tax officials to get the dues lowered to JPY2.6 million ($24,300).
On May 1, Tenma announced on its website that the CEO implicated in the bribery would announce his resignation at a shareholders' meeting in June.
The company is being investigated for bribing foreign officials and violating unfair competition laws in Japan.
To Lam, Vietnam's Minister of Public Security, said Tuesday that Vietnam was cooperating with Japan on the investigation.
The information of Tenma bribing Vietnamese officials came from Japan, so we need international coordination to investigate this case, Lam said on the sidelines of a parliament session in Hanoi.
Representatives from Bac Ninh's People Committee, the highest executive body in the province, said Tuesday that a preliminary review by local police has not showed any abnormal signs.
Tenma Vietnam continues to operate normally at the Que Vo Industrial Zone in Bac Ninh.
Company representatives told local media that all of its senior officials are either away from the province or still in Japan.

Costa Rica celebrates first same-sex weddings.
The first same-sex weddings have taken place in Costa Rica, the first Central American country to approve its marriage legislation.
A lesbian couple became the first to tie the knot in a ceremony that took place just after the new law came into effect at midnight.
The wedding was shown on national TV.
President Carlos Alvarado said the law change meant Costa Rica now recognised the rights lesbian and gay people had always deserved.
He tweeted (in Spanish) that empathy and love should from now on be the guiding principles which will allow us to move forward and build a country where there is room for everyone.
The first same-sex marriage ceremony was broadcast as the culmination of a three-hour programme celebrating marriage equality.
Marriage equality came about after the constitutional court declared in August 2018 that a ban on same-sex weddings was unconstitutional and discriminatory.
The court gave Costa Rica's parliament 18 months to change the law.
Enrique Sánchez, Costa Rica's first openly gay member of parliament, welcomed the change and praised those who had spent years lobbying for the same-sex marriage ban to be lifted.

Zika infection confirmed in Da Nang.
A man in Da Nang has been found infected with the Zika virus, which causes microcephaly in babies, the first case in Vietnam in three years.
The unidentified man, 25, lives in Lien Chieu District and is under treatment, Pham Hung, head of the General Department of Preventative Medicine's department for communicable disease control, said on Monday.
The Zika virus is primarily spread through mosquitoes and potentially transmitted sexually, from mother to child and through blood transfusion.
The disease it causes, Zika fever, produces mild symptoms like fever, red eyes, joint pain, headache, or rash in humans.
But it is known to cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies born to mothers infected during pregnancy.
Microcephaly causes an abnormally small head, intellectual disability and poor motor and speech functions.
There is no vaccine yet against Zika.
Vietnam's first reported case of Zika virus infection was in 2016 in the south-central province of Khanh Hoa.
By early 2017 the country recorded 265 cases.
One baby was born with microcephaly linked to the Zika virus in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak in 2016.
Like other diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, Zika virus outbreaks occur mostly during the rainy season.
In Vietnam, most cases have been recorded in the south but also in the central region and the Central Highlands.
Hundreds of marijuana plants grown in the coffee plantations discovered.
Police in Krông Năng District in the Central Highlands Province of Đắk Lắk have discovered hundreds of marijuana plants grown in the coffee plantations of two households.
The owners claimed they had only been growing the plants to feed their chickens, believing their leaves had medicinal qualities to help poultry avoid diseases.
Bui Thi Loan, 48 years old and her brother Bùi Thái Phong, 37 years old, both residing in Trường Hà Hamlet, Ea Hồ Commune have reportedly grown and harvested marijuana for a long time.
Police counted 442 marijuana plants in Loan's garden and 139 in Phong's garden with the highest plant reaching 2.5m tall.
They were also nursing hundreds of young plants.
Their farms were located in quiet areas and marijuana was grown together with coffee, allegedly to hide the illegal cultivation.
In 2013, the police of H.Krong Pak District in the same province found 1,042 marijuana plants in a garden of a local woman.
The grower said that she used the plant to feed pigs, fish, chickens, and ducks and did not know marijuana was harmful.
Loan and Phong could face the fines from VNĐ2 million to VNĐ5 million (US$85-214) for growing the banned plants.
Vietnam investigates alleged $215,000 bribery by Japanese firm.
Vietnam is investigating reports that a Japanese plastic company bribed Vietnamese officials JPY25 million ($215,000) to escape tax duties and fines.
The Finance Ministry has formed an investigation team to verify recent reports by some Japanese newspapers including Asahi that plastic firm Tenma had bribed Vietnamese officials on two occasions in 2017 and last year.
Asahi said that Tenma representatives on April 1 confessed to prosecutors in Tokyo that its subsidiary Tenma Vietnam in June 2017 had imported a batch of molds and Vietnamese officials demanded a value-added tax of JPY1.8 billion ($16.7 million).
To avoid this obligation, the CEO of Tenma Vietnam, which is based in the northern province of Bac Ninh, had paid a senior customs official VND2 billion (JPY10 million or about $86,000) in cash.
The newspaper also reported that in August last year, Bac Ninh tax authorities had asked Tenma Vietnam to pay tax dues, including corporate income tax, worth JPY89 million ($826,400).
Tenma Vietnam paid VND3 billion (JPY15 million or around $129,000) in cash to tax officials to get the tax lowered to JPY2.6 million ($24,300), the report said.
On May 1, Tenma announced on its website that the CEO implicated in the bribery will announce his resignation at a shareholders' meeting in June.
The company is being investigated for bribing foreign officials and violating unfair competition laws in Japan.
Bac Ninh customs officials have denied the allegations.
Pham Chi Thanh, deputy head of Bac Ninh Customs Department, said that Tenma, as a firm involved in processing for export, is eligible for zero import and value-added tax duties under Vietnamese law.
This means its imported goods does not have to pay any tax, and allegations that customs officials have received bribes for reducing the company's tax dues are baseless, he said.
Ngo Xuan Tong, director of Bac Ninh Taxation Department, said that apart from the newspaper report, his department has not received any official document from Japanese authorities on the matter.
He said that the department had only fined the company VND500 million ($21,500) for its delay in paying income tax on a portion of revenue, which are not related to the above-mentioned import tax incentives.
Tenma Vietnam was established at the Que Vo Industrial Park in Bac Ninh Province in 2007.
It produces plastic parts for vehicles and household items.
Workers plunge to death as scaffolding cable snaps at dam construction site.
Three people died and three others were injured after a scaffolding cable snapped at a hydropower construction site in Kon Tum Province Monday.

Tree falls in Saigon school, kills boy.
One student died at a Saigon public school and 12 others were injured after a tree suddenly fell on them on Tuesday morning.
At around 6.15 a.m., a 10-meter flamboyant tree of more than 50 years old in the yard of Bach Dang Secondary School in District 3 toppled and fell on a group of 13 sixth grade students sitting under it, Nguyen Van Phuc, the school principal, said.
Tran Hong Vu, a father, witnessed what he described as chaotic when he brought his child to school this morning.
I just arrived at the gate when I heard the thundering sound of the falling tree.
Then many students were screaming.
The schoolyard was in chaos.
Teachers and parents quickly pulled the students out, and ambulances took them to Children's Hospital No 2.
At around 9 a.m one of the victims, who has not been identified by the school, succumbed to his injuries.
More than 20 police officers cordoned off the scene of the tragedy.
Anxious parents flocked to the school to find out if their children were alright, but could not reach the management.
Many parts of the city, especially Districts 1, 3, 5, and 10, had received heavy rainfall on Monday afternoon.

Japanese firm allegedly bribes Vietnamese customs officials.
The Japanese media has reported that a Japanese plastic firm has admitted to giving bribes to Vietnamese officials to avoid paying taxes, said Thanh Nien Online newspaper.
According to an article in Asahi newspaper on May 11, Tenma Vietnam voluntarily reported to prosecutors in Tokyo that its affiliate in Bac Ninh Province had given bribes totaling some 25 million Japanese yen, or VND5.4 billion, to local customs and tax officials to dodge tax payments.
Prosecutors in Tokyo determined that Tenma Vietnam had violated Japan's laws against unhealthy competition, which prohibit firms from giving bribes to foreign officials.
Tenma's parent firm, based in Tokyo, has established a committee to investigate the case.
According to an April report from the committee, Tenma Vietnam in June 2017 received a notice on value-added tax payments levied on imported goods worth some VND400 billion.
Executives of Tenma Vietnam suggested the parent company issue bribes to local customs officials to enjoy tax exemptions or reductions.
With the approval of Kento Fujino, chairman of the parent company, Tenma Vietnam gave VND2 billion to Vietnamese officials, Asahi noted.
Besides this, in June 2019, Tenma Vietnam was asked to pay an additional amount of VND17.8 billion in taxes, as local customs officials had found that some of its earnings were not subject to preferential tax policies.
Therefore, Tenma Vietnam paid some VND3 billion to the officials to reduce the tax amount from VND17.8 billion to some VND567.7 million, according to The Nikkei.
Tenma voluntarily submitted the investigation results to the Tokyo Court on April 1.
It has yet to comment on the case.
Established in 1949, Tenma specializes in plastic shelf manufacturing, with combined revenue reaching 84.7 billion yen at the end of March 2019.

Environment Ministry proposes promoting eco-friendly vehicles.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has proposed launching support policies and preferential programs for the use of vehicles powered by renewable energy to ease air pollution, according to a report the ministry has sent to the prime minister.
The ministry noted that the leader of the ministry had written this report based on international studies on the management and development of environmentally-friendly vehicles.

China says virus pushing US ties to brink of Cold War.
China said Sunday that its relations with the United States were on the brink of a new Cold War, fuelled partly by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and pitched the global economy into a massive downturn.
More European nations meanwhile moved to ease their lockdowns, with virus trends improving and summer nearing.

Globally, more than 5,3 million people have been infected by the virus, which most scientists believe jumped from animals to humans – possibly late last year at a market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, suggesting the virus may have leaked from a top-security Chinese laboratory.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a political virus but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.
While once hard-hit European nations relax lockdowns as they work to salvage battered economies, other countries such as Brazil are emerging as new centres of the pandemic.
Trump on Sunday suspended travel to the US by non-Americans leaving from Brazil.
There was no immediate comment from the Brazilian government, run by Trump ally President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been dismissive of the virus and of lockdown measures.
The US death toll rose Sunday night to 97,686, according to the Johns Hopkins University, with more than 1.64 million cases of infection.
The US is by far the country worst hit.
Taiwan promises 'necessary assistance' to Hong Kong's people.
Taiwan will provide the people of Hong Kong with necessary assistance, Taiwan leader Tsai Ing-wen said, after a resurgence in protests in the Chinese ruled territory against newly proposed national security legislation from Beijing.
Taiwan has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, which has been convulsed since last year by protests.
Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Sunday to protest against Beijing's plan to impose national security laws on the city.
Writing on her Facebook page late on Sunday, Tsai said the proposed legislation was a serious threat to Hong Kong's freedoms and judicial independence.
Bullets and repression are not the way to deal with the aspirations of Hong Kong's people for freedom and democracy, she added.
In face of the changing situation, the international community has proactively stretched out a helping hand to Hong Kong's people, Tsai wrote.
Taiwan will even more proactively perfect and forge ahead with relevant support work, and provide Hong Kong's people with necessary assistance, she wrote.
Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who seek asylum on the island.
Its laws do promise, though, to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.
The Hong Kong protests have won widespread sympathy in Taiwan, and the support for the protesters by Tsai and her administration have worsened already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing.
China has accused supporters of Taiwan independence of colluding with the protesters.
China believes Tsai to be a separatist bent on declaring the island's formal independence.
Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

German pharma giant CEO to Vietnam fined for nine-dash line mistake.
The Malaysian CEO of Bayer Vietnam was fined VND30 million ($1,300) Thursday for forwarding staff a document containing China's infamous nine-dash line.
The punishment, imposed by Ho Chi Minh City's Department of Information and Communications, came days after Lynette Moey Yu Lin, a Malaysian of Chinese origin, admitted sharing the document on China's successful Covid-19 campaign with nine department heads late last month.
These managers were supposed to subsequently forward it to lower-ranking staff.

Saigontourist, a leading Vietnamese travel company, was fined VND50 million ($2,200) for using brochures depicting China's illegal claims.
CGV, Vietnam's largest cinema chain, was fined VND170 million ($7,400) for licensing the film Abominable that includes the nine-dash demarcation.

Court upholds prison sentence against former HCMC official in murky land handover.
Former director of the HCMC Department of Natural Resources and Environment Dao Anh Kiet had his 6.5-year prison sentence upheld, following his earlier conviction in the illegal handover of public land to notorious real estate tycoon Phan Van Anh Vu.
The HCMC High-level People's Court on Friday turned down all appeals filed by the 63-year-old Kiet and three other individuals, in connection with the illegal handover of the 5,000-square-meter property at No.15 Thi Sach Street in District 1 to one of Vu's firms, Bac Nam 79 Construction JSC, reported the local media.
The three others convicted in the scheme were Truong Van Ut, 50, former deputy head of the department's Land Management Division. Le Van Thanh, 57, former deputy chief of the HCMC People's Committee Office. and Nguyen Thanh Chuong, 45, former head of the office's Urban Division.
The panel of judges said the behaviors, and roles played by the four defendants, were the basis of the first-instance trial in December 2019, and they failed to provide any new extenuating circumstances at this appeal trial.
Given this, the jury rejected their appeals and upheld the initial sentences.
Therefore, Kiet will have to spend six-and-a-half years in prison, Ut – five years, Thanh – four years, and Chuong – three years, for irregularities in the management and use of State assets, leading to losses and wastefulness.
The 44-year-old Vu, who moonlighted as an operative for the General Department of Intelligence with the Ministry of Public Security in 2009 and left the organization in 2017, was found to have proposed that the then-leaders of the ministry sign various legal documents that were sent to the HCMC People's Committee in 2014.
The aim of the proposal was to enable his company, as a front for the ministry's General Department of Intelligence, to lease the No.15 Thi Sach Street property with a no-bid contract for the ministry's professional operations, according to the indictment.
Since the proposal was granted, his company has collaborated with other firms to execute a construction project for Vu's personal gain.
The indictment states that Nguyen Huu Tin, 62, who was the municipal deputy chairman in charge of construction and land management between 2011 and 2016, had approved the lease deal in June 2015, restricting the company from being able to transfer, sublease or mortgage the prime land or raise revenues through the sale or lease of its land-use rights.
However, Tin signed another decision later that year allowing the company to become an investor for a trading, service and apartment complex project.
He later instructed the company to work with the city's agencies to complete preparatory procedures for the project.
As a result, the local government approved the project in May 2016.
Kiet, Ut, Thanh and Chuong allegedly sought advice from Tin in handing over the land to the company.
The company was not required to pay compensation for assets and architectural objects on the land, nor rent for the land, which flouted prevailing regulations.
Their errors caused State losses of VND6.7 billion.
Also, Vu and his partners have built a 18-story building and later put it up for sale and lease, earning revenues of more than VND1 trillion.
In this case, Tin, the city's former leader, did not appeal his seven-year prison sentence.

Central Vietnam port refuses foreign cruise ships as coronavirus drops anchor.
Chan May Port in central Thua Thien-Hue Province decided Friday to stop receiving all international cruise ships as the Covid-19 threat escalates.
The decision follows Vietnam recording 28 coronavirus cases as of Friday morning after the country going 22 days without any new infection.
The World Health Organization on Friday named Europe the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier, 24 international cruise ships canceled plans to dock at Chan May Port over Covid-19 concerns.

A photo of AirPod Pro case with Assembled in Vietnam message.
The Nikkei Asian Review had previously reported that AirPods have been mass-produced in Vietnam since early March, quoting.
the Vietnamese officials even granted special permits for a key Apple AirPods assembler to help the company bring in engineers to the country for smooth production during lockdowns.
However, this factory did not assemble the high-end AirPods Pro.
On social media and online forums, the AirPods Pros made in Vietnam have received positive reviews.
A person with the account name MrGimper wrote in the MacRumors forum.
I am quite surprised that Apple is manufacturing AirPods Pro in Vietnam.
I am using the second-generation of AirPods assembled in Vietnam and am very pleased with the quality of the product.
I hope it will be the same for the AirPods Pro.
Cole Slaw said.
Apple is diversifying its supply chain and that's good for the world.
I hope other U.S companies will follow suit to reduce their dependence on China.
The 'Technology lovers' section on China's Weibo said.
This is the first time a new Apple device has been made outside of China.
Many other Apple manufacturing partners are also planning to move out of China.
Vietnam is an attractive destination because of cheap labor and good infrastructure.
This is not the first time Apple is diversifying its manufacturing base.
In 2017 it assembled some iPhone models in India.
In June last year the Nikkei Asian Review reported that Apple had asked its suppliers to look for ways to shift 15 percent to 30 percent of production from China to other parts of Southeast Asia amid the trade war between the world's two largest economies.
In the past few months Apple has listed many job vacancies in Vietnam on LinkedIn.
HCMC pushes ahead with Vietnam's Silicon Valley plan.
The prime minister's support for the 'Vietnam's Silicon Valley' initiative has prompted HCMC to push ahead with a plan to merge three districts into one administrative unit.
The plan, which will to combine Districts 2, 9 and Thu Duc into one administrative unit and make it an innovative urban area, has been submitted by the municipal Home Affairs Department to the Ho Chi Minh City People's Committee.
The department has come up with the plan following a meeting between Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc and the city on May 8.
The plan to make a city within a city, temporarily called the Eastern Town, won the PM's endorsement.
This area has been in the making since 2017.
It would encompass the hi-tech park in District 9, the university precinct in Thu Duc District and the new urban area and financial center on the Thu Thiem Peninsula in District 2.
The Eastern Town is also expected to contribute to the establishment of value added chains based on high technology, modern technical and social infrastructure of international standards, and effective financial support for businesses.
It was to play a key role in linking scientific and technical research with commercial production to lift residents' lifestyle to international standards.
Le Van Thanh of the HCMC Institute for Development Studies had said.
This will be Vietnam's Silicon Valley.
The innovative hub would cover more than 22,000 hectares (54,300 acres) with a population of over 1.1 million.
Once the plan is implemented, HCMC will have 22 instead of 24 districts.
At the May 8 meeting, PM Phuc, while endorsing the merger of districts, said its official name will be decided later.
He also assigned the Ministry of Justice to guide the city on the next steps to take.
Former deputy defence minister on trial for land fraud.
A Navy Court Martial on Monday opened the first instance hearing regarding the mismanagement of defence land in HCM City's District 1 in which former deputy defence minister Nguyễn Văn Hiến, other Navy officials and company leaders are accused.
According to the verdict of the Central Military Procuracy, when Hiến was deputy defence minister and commander of the Viet Nam People's Navy, he signed and approved the use of defence land on Tôn Đức Thắng Street, Bến Nghé Ward for economic purposes without verifying the information provided by his subordinates.
This broke Defence Ministry and Government regulations, as well as the 2013 Land Law.
Hiến is accused of failing to supervise financial contributions and ignoring orders from the Defence Ministry.
These included his duty to verify why authorisation was given to a Hải Thành Company director to sign venture contracts, which resulted in partners using land-use rights certificates to take out mortages, change the nature of the ownership and transfer the land to third parties.
As a result, the Navy lost the right to manage and use three plots of land for 49 years, causing losses of VNĐ939 billion to the State budget.
On Monday, Nguyễn Văn Hiến, 67 and retired, was charged with lack of responsibility, causing serious consequences in accordance with Clause 3, Article 360 of the 2015 Penal Code.
Those accused of fraud and appropriation of assets included Đinh Ngọc Hệ, deputy general director of the Thái Sơn Corporation under the Ministry of National Defence, and chairman and general director of the Thái Sơn Development and Investment JSC.
Phạm Văn Diệt, general director of the Đức Bình Group Joint Stock Company and managing director of the Yên Khánh Production, Trading Service Limited Company.
and Vu ThiHoan, director of the Yên Khánh Production, Trading Service Limited Company and director of the Yên Khánh Hải Thành Limited Company.
Bui Nhu Thiem, former head of the Economics Division at the Viet Nam People's Navy.
Bui Van Nga, former director of the Hài Thành Service and Sea Island Tourism One-Member Limited Liability Company at the Viet Nam People's Navy.
and Tran Trong Tuan, deputy director of the Hải Thành Service and Sea Island Tourism One-Member Limited Liability Company, are also being prosecuted for violating regulations on land management.
At its 12th plenum last week, the Party Central Committee considered and decided upon disciplinary measures against Hiến - expelling him from the Party.
Bui Nhu Thiem, Doan Manh Thao, Bui Van Nga and Tran Ngoc Tuan were accused of making false proposals that led to Hiến's lack of oversight and subsequent approval of the documents, which caused great losses.
Dinh Ngoc He, Pham Van Duyet and Vu Thi Hoan were accused of acting fraudulently by forging signatures to transfer land use rights from Hải Thành Company to Yên Khánh Hải Thành Company for use as collateral for bank loans.
At a trial on July 31, 2018, the Military Court of Military Zone 7 sentenced Đinh Ngọc Hệ to ten years in jail for abusing his position and power while performing duties, and another two years for using falsified documents from agencies and organisations.
According to the Central Military Procuracy, when signing venture contracts the accused ignored land prices set by the HCM City People's Committee and agreed on deals for far less money.
As a result, between September 4, 2006 to 2018, the State lost over VNĐ20 billion.
Hien, Thiem, Nga and Thap were convicted of being complicit to the loss.
However, on Monday the Central Military Procuracy overturned that ruling as there was not enough evidence to support the convictions.
The first instance hearing is expected to run until May 20.
Hoa Binh Court sentences 15 in high school exam cheating scandal.
The People's Court of Hòa Bình Province on Thursday sentenced 15 defendants involved in the 2017-18 national high school exam cheating scandal in which dozens of candidates had their exam scores raised so they could graduate high school and enroll in universities or colleges.
Thirteen out of 15 defendants were charged with abuse of power while performing their official duties to inflate the exam scores of students.
Nguyen Quang Vinh, 54, former head of the Testing and Quality Assurance Unit under Hoa Binh Province's Education and Training Department was given eight years in jail for abuse of power while performing official duties.
Khương Ngọc Chất, 39, former head of the Internal Political Security Division under the Hòa Bình Police, Diệp Thị Hồng Liên, former vice head of the Testing and Quality Assurance Unit and Nguyễn Khắc Tuấn, an official of the unit were sentenced to six, five and three years in jail, respectively, for the same charge.
Do Manh Tuan, 41, former vice-principal of Lac Thuy District Secondary and High School was given seven years in jail for receiving bribes and three years for abuse of power.
Ho Chuc, 45, a former teacher of Thanh Hà High School in Lac Thuy District was sentenced to 30 months in prison for giving bribes.
Other defendants who are former education officials and teachers in the province were given 15 to 30 months either in jail or suspended for abuse of power while performing their official duties.
According to the indictment, the defendants have taken advantage of their positions and made use of their relationships to collude and intervene to raise the marks of candidates in the national high school exam in 2017 and 2018.
The intervention raised marks for 65 candidates who sat for the national exam in 2018 and one candidate who sat for the national exam in 2017.
Of the candidates benefiting from the scheme, 45 were forced to quit school after their exams were re-marked objectively, ten others could continue their university courses as their remarked scores were eligible for university admission.
Six other candidates did not attend university courses even though their re-marked scores met universities' requirements, one candidate failed to get university admission while another candidate did not apply for any university or college.
Court rejects defendants' appeal in fake medicine case.
The People's Court in HCM City on Wednesday upheld the verdict handed down at the first-instance trial in a case involving the manufacturing and trading of counterfeit medicine.
At the first-instance trial that concluded in October, Nguyen Minh Hung, former general director of Viet Nam Pharma Joint Stock Company (VN Pharma), was sentenced to 17 years in prison, and Võ Mạnh Cường, former director of H&C International Maritime Trading Co., Ltd, to 20 years.
Both faced charges of manufacturing and trading counterfeit medicines for treatment or prevention of diseases under Article 157 of the Penal Code, according to the city's People's Procuracy.
The remaining 10 defendants were sentenced from three to 12 years in prison.
Hung did not appeal after the first-instance trial.
However, seven of the 12 defendants in the case, including Cường, filed an appeal against the verdict reached at the first-instance trial.
Cuong said he did not play a mastermind role as mentioned in the first-instance verdict and that he did not know the drugs were counterfeit.
But the city's People's Procuracy rejected biện minh này, saying Cường directly contacted people who made counterfeit drugs and asked for permission to import the batch of fake drugs.
According to the People's Procuracy, the wrongful acts of the defendants were dangerous to society and the sentence at the first-instance trial was lawful and appropriate.
VN Pharma was established in October 2011 with the capital of VNĐ25 billion (US$1.075 million), rising to VNĐ40 billion in 2014.
Hùng owns most of the shares.
Since its operation, the company has imported various kinds of drugs.
From 2013 to 2014, Hùng ordered Cường to buy imported medicine that was allegedly manufactured by Canada's Helix Pharmaceuticals Company and supply the drugs to Vietnamese hospitals.
The order included 9,300 boxes of 500mg capsules of H-Capita, a cancer treatment drug.
The consignment was worth around VNĐ5.3 billion.
Hung said he ordered his staff to fake documents related to the drugs and submit them to the Drug Administration of Viet Nam, which operates under the Ministry of Health.
Hung also faked receipts and payment procedures to acquire import licences from the ministry.
In April 2014, the Drug Administration of Viet Nam questioned the origin of the drugs and decided to inspect the company's shipments.
The Ministry of Health concluded that the H-Capita 500mg batch contained 97 percent of the active ingredient capecitabine, which is of unknown origin and poor quality, and must not be used as a medicine for humans.
The Procuracy said Hùng's actions caused damage of more than VNĐ6 billion (US$255,320) to VN Pharma.
The court on Wednesday also asked the Ministry of Health to examine whether import companies have inflated drug prices to give commissions to doctors to sell the drugs.
This has resulted in high prices for imported drugs in Viet Nam, seriously affecting the quality of life, especially for the poor.
AstraZeneca ready to supply potential vaccine in September.
Drugs giant AstraZeneca has announced it is ready to provide a potential new coronavirus vaccine from September.
The firm said it had concluded deals to deliver at least 400 million doses of the vaccine, which it is developing with Oxford University.
AstraZeneca said it was capable of producing one billion doses of the AZD1222 vaccine this year and next.
Initial trials are under way and AstraZeneca said it recognised that the vaccine might not work.
But the company said it was committed to advancing the clinical programme.
Scientists have warned that a coronavirus vaccine, if developed, might not confer full immunity, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that a vaccine might never be found.
Despite these reservations, intensive research continues, with about 80 groups around the world working on possible vaccines.
AstraZeneca indicated that production would take place in more than one country.
It thanked the UK and US governments for substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine.
AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot described the coronavirus pandemic as a global tragedy and a challenge for all of humanity.
We need to defeat the virus together or it will continue to inflict huge personal suffering and leave long-lasting economic and social scars in every country around the world, he said.
We are so proud to be collaborating with Oxford University to turn their ground-breaking work into a medicine that can be produced on a global scale.
Company director arrested following deadly wall collapse.
The director of the construction company responsible for building a wall which collapsed killing 10 people has been arrested.
Ha Duy Hai, Director of Ha Hai Nga Co Ltd, has been detained by police in the southern province of Đồng Nai.
The 56-year-old's company was contracted to carrying work at AV Healthcare Company at the Giang Điền Industrial Park.
But on May 14, part of the eight metre high, 109m long wall collapsed, leaving 10 people dead and injuring another 14.
Right after the accident, the Prime Minister sent a notice to the People's Committee of Đồng Nai Province, ordering a prompt investigation into the case and strict punishment of violations in line with legal regulations.
AV Healthcare Company has leased more than 21,000 sq.m of land at the Giang Điền Industrial Park to build a factory specialising in producing diapers, milk bottles and tampons.
It hired a company as the constructor of the project.
Five million 'made-in-Viet Nam' medical protective equipment transported to New York.
A Vietnamese company has shipped five million medical protective supplies to authorities in New York, US.
Huynh Quoc Dinh, director of Super Cargo Service said the protective suits, face masks and gloves had been transported to New York to support the hard-hit city in the fight against COVID-19.
The company has co-operated with four airlines - Ethiopia Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Eva Airlines and Philippines Airlines – to transport the equipment on eight big-sized planes.
The New York authorities reportedly received the last batch on May 20's afternoon (local time), he said.
In early May, CBS News reported that New York Mayor York Bill de Blasio had discussed buying medical protective equipment from Viet Nam.
He said the city had ordered a factory in Viet Nam to manufacture the equipment in large quantities for the to help the US city.
New York is one of the biggest coronavirus hot spots in the US with more than 364,000 positive cases and more than 28,700 deaths as of the morning May 21.
Health ministry considers repatriating British pilot after being treated for coronavirus.
The 43-year-old British pilot working for national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines, identified as the country's Patient No.
91, has tested negative six times for the novel strain of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
A sample of the virus taken from the patient and cultivated in the HCM City Pasteur Institute shows that he has developed immunity and won't get reinfected by the virus.
Chợ Rẫy Hospital in HCM City has received the patient from the HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases, where he has been treated since he was confirmed to be positive for the virus in mid-March, to continue providing intensive care, treat his underlying conditions, and manage the infections.
The patient will receive frequent consultations from the leading medical experts of the country to determine the optimal time to carry out a lung transplant operation, as his lung functions have deteriorated and he remains on life support.
Assoc.Prof.Lương Ngọc Khuê, Director of the Medical Examination and Treatment Management Department under the health ministry, said via the UK embassy in Việt Nam, the health ministry has not been able to contact any of the patient's direct relatives.
They have received information about a relative of the patient in the UK, but there has not yet been any response regarding the patient's treatment and possible repatriation, given that organ transplant can only be conducted with the relative's consent as long as the patient remains unconscious.
Khuê said that a foreign doctor working in medical transport in Việt Nam has contacted him and volunteered to bring the patient back to the UK, but the matter is being considered by the health ministry's leadership.
The patient reportedly has no insurance, but the costs for a lung transplant is already covered by donations from a benefactor organisation.
In just a week, more than 59 people – the oldest 76 years old, and the youngest 21 years old – have come forward to register to donate their lungs for the patient following reports of doctors looking at the possibility of a lung transplant to save his life, Khuê said, adding that this showcases the spirit of solidarity and compassion of the Vietnamese people.
Another option on the table is to repatriate the patient since he is now treated of COVID-19, but there are many complicating issues that may render the plan infeasible.
The patient remains in a coma and still relies on ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) for survival, so we need to wait until the patient is awake and recovers, then we can make an appropriate plan, the health official remarked.
So far, the treatment for the British pilot has lasted two months and three days, with the patient needing to be placed on life support for 46 days.
The latest CT scan of the patient's lungs show they have improved by about 20-30 per cent, while the patient's pulse and blood pressure have stabilised.
LGBT-themed movie a Netflix Vietnam favorite.
Goodbye Mother, an LGBT-themed movie, is the sole local production in Netflix Vietnam's ranking of 10 most-watched dramas.
Data thus far has shown that Vietnamese overwhelmingly favor South Korean TV dramas over other content on Netflix Vietnam, accounting for six of the top 10 most-watched shows Friday.
Topping the list was Money Heist, a Spanish television crime drama series on a bank robbery.
It is not often that a Vietnamese film breaks into the list of most popular shows among Vietnamese audiences since Netflix, worldwide streamer of movies and TV shows, began releasing its daily list since late February.
Goodbye Mother, screened on Netflix since April 1 last year, depicts the drama of Van and his boyfriend Ian, who've just returned to Vietnam from the U.S.
The couple are initially unable to come out about their relationship because of the taboo involved, especially in rural Vietnam.
This leads to friction between them, and Van is forced to explain the nature of their relationship to his mother.
The movie is the directorial debut of Trinh Dinh Le Minh, who studied directing at the University of Texas in the U.S.
He had done a few short films before embarking on his first full-length feature film.
Netflix has been available in Vietnam since 2016 at VND180,000 ($7.8) a month for a basic subscription.
It now boasts a total 31 Vietnamese films covering romantic, comedy, action to horror and adventure genres.
The service, with around 167 million subscribers in over 190 countries and territories by Q4 2019, has been seeking to produce and acquire rights for more Asian content to increase its number of global subscribers.
Netflix launched its Vietnamese language website last October.
Golden Kite award recognises actress' efforts.
Actress Hồng Diễm won the Golden Kite for her performance in television series Hoa Hồng Trên Ngực Trái (Rose on Left Chest) last week.
It was her first award for her ten-year career in the film industry.
She said in an interview with the actress about the award and her career, I'm moved because it is the first award in my career.
It also surprised me a lot.
I did not think that the leading role in a television series would win me the award.
I'm happy.
I want to thank the judges, the crew, and the fans for recognizing my efforts.
Hồng Diễm was a model before she became an actress.
It's taken her a long time to gain success in film.
I think that winning an award is not just about talent because you also need some luck.
I was the luckiest among the nominees at the Gold Kite awards.
She said, this award encouraged her and also challenges her.
I have to work harder in different types of roles.
I have never been asked to perform the role of a strong character or a gangster.
I think directors want me in roles they know I can play, so I haven't had much choice.
Normally, I perform the role of a woman who accepts her fate, but sometimes this type of role bores me.
I like performing a role that is different and my part in Rose on Left Chest gave me that chance.
I like the role and can sympathize with the character.
I understand what she has to endure and why she finds it difficult to get a divorce.
Gold bullion producer reports huge profit surge.
The state-owned Saigon Jewelry Company recorded VND52.45 billion ($2.25 million) in post-tax profits last year, up 88.8 percent year-on-year.
Revenue rose 10.8 percent year-on-year to VND23.13 trillion ($990.68 million), which puts the jewelry firm's net profit margin at around 0.3 percent, according to Saigon Jewelry Company's (SJC) newly released audited financial statements for 2019.
The company has set a revenue target of VND25.7 trillion ($1.11 billion) in 2020.
SJC is Vietnam's national gold brand and the sole producer of gold bullion in the country.
The company has held around 90 percent of Vietnam's gold bullion market.
Established in 1988, Saigon Jewelry Company is a wholly state-owned enterprise under the People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City.
The company primarily produces and trades gold bars and jewelry, but also has investments in real estate, finance, and services.
The company's profit-making was at its highest between 2011 and 2013 when SJC made around VND200-300 billion ($8.57-12.85 million) in post-tax profits each year.
This fell to less than VND100 billion ($4.28 million) after the SBV tightened regulations on gold trading, alongside a cooling of Vietnam's domestic gold market, the company statement said.
SJC is one of 27 state-owned enterprises awaiting equitization, following which the state's stake will be less than 50 percent.
The equitization is set to take place this year under a plan set out by the Prime Minister.
Trà Vinh farmers expand organic rice areas.
The Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta province of Tra Vinh has encouraged farmers to expand environmentally friendly organic rice fields that have improved the quality of rice and soil fertility.
In Cầu Ngang, more than 100 farmers in Cầu Ngang's Mỹ Hòa, Kim Hòa, Vinh Kim and Hiep Hoa communes signed a contract in 2017 with a company to grow organic rice on a total area of 82ha.
The company provided farmers with techniques such as sowing, fertilising, disease management, and harvest methods.
The company also supplied materials, and it guaranteed outlets for the farmers.
In the first organic rice crop, the farmers earned a profit of VNĐ30 million (US$1,300) per hectare per crop, up VNĐ6 million ($260) compared to normal farming methods.
Organic rice fields use less fertiliser and do not use chemicals.
Farmers can also breed aquatic species in ditches in the rice fields to earn additional income, or rotate rice and aquatic species on the same fields.
Thạch Mara, who has planted organic rice in Hiep Hoa Commune since 2017, said rice grown under organic standards develops well and adapts to climate change.
In his first crop, his 0.4ha rice field had a yield of 6 tonnes per ha, up one tonne compared to traditional farming methods.
He expanded the organic rice area to 0.7ha this year.
Tran Hong Nghiep, an agricultural official in Hiep Hoa, said to encourage farmers to grow organic rice, the commune guarantees outlets for farmers and link them with others who produce organic rice.
The commune's organic rice co-operative group has called on farmers to join the group which can easily link up with companies and access government support policies.
The group now has 49 members who grow a total of 52ha of organic rice.
Its members who rotate organic rice cultivation and black tiger shrimp or giant river prawn breeding on their rice fields earn a profit of VNĐ50 - 60 million ($2,200 - 2,600) per ha for each shrimp crop.
Nguyen Ngoc Hai, deputy director of the province's Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, said that farmers, companies and the State have developed linkages under the organic model, which has improved the value and quality of the province's rice.
Besides the health benefits of organic food, organic farming improves soil fertility and protects aquatic resources.
Trà Vinh grows more than 200,000ha of rice each year, but has only a few hundred ha of rice planted under organic standards.
The coastal province plans to increase its organic rice area to 1,000ha by the end of this year and to 2,500ha by 2030.
Long An Province faces severe water shortage.
The drought-hit Mekong Delta province of Long An this year needs more fresh water, but can only supply about 50 per cent of demand from its 35 fresh water treatment plants and stations.
Nearly 736,000cu.m of water will be needed by 2030, according to the province's planning on water supply.
Currently, its plants can only supply 206,000cu.m of fresh water.
It lacks more than 215,000cu.m of fresh water to serve industrial and urban development and people's daily activities.
In urban areas, fresh water is supplied by small and medium-sized plants operated by Long An Water Supply Sewerage Joint Stock Company, Kiến Tường Water Supply Sewerage and Environment Joint Stock Company, and others.
In rural areas, small water supply stations provide water to fewer than 300 households.
Nearly 40 per cent of the province's residents use fresh water, which is lower than the average national rate.
Authorities are concerned that the problem could become severe if they do not have solutions.
The province's People's Committee has instructed relevant agencies to adjust water supply to increase the usage rate among residents.
The province also wants to reduce underground water exploitation gradually, and attract investment to build a network of fresh water supply stations.
It has asked ministries for funds to build five sluices to prevent saltwater intrusion in the provinces of Long An and Tiền Giang, near Vàm Cỏ Tây River which supplies the Rạch Chanh Water Plant.
The province plans to build a reservoir to store fresh water in Thạnh Hóa District to supply water to nearly 12,000 households and for agricultural and industrial production.
In Cần Đước District's Phước Tuy Commune, which faced water shortage in the dry season, residents now have access to fresh water after the commune's People's Committee allocated funds to upgrade water supply pipelines and presented water containers to people who live far from water wells.
People have also been encouraged to use water economically.
The committee has called on enterprises to invest in water wells.
The commune has nine wells that supply water to more than 2,000 households.
Long An is one of several Mekong Delta provinces severely affected by drought and saltwater intrusion every year.
More than 8,000 households in the province lack fresh water.
In a similar situation, trees in mangrove forests in Mekong Delta Sóc Trăng Province's Vĩnh Châu Town have died or are dying because of water shortage, according to the town's Forest Protection Bureau.
Trees have died in a 1.5ha mangrove forest managed by the town's People's Committee and in a 175ha mangrove forest managed by the bureau.
The mangrove forests are mostly white mangrove and spotted mangrove more than 10 years old.
The upgrading and construction of a sea dike and a dam outside the mangrove forests to prevent saltwater intrusion has contributed to water shortage, according to the bureau.
Vietnam prepares second phase testing of Covid-19 vaccine.
A potential Covid-19 vaccine produced in Vietnam will be tested on 30 mice in order to determine its most effective dose.
The second phase of testing will be carried out early June, said Dr. Do Tuan Dat, head of the Hanoi-based VABIOTECH company, which produces vaccines.
During the first testing phase, 50 mice in the lab remained healthy two weeks after they were injected with the vaccine on April 26.
On May 14, researchers sent the mice's blood samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology for first evaluation.
The vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists of VABIOTECH and the U.K.'s Bristol University.
Dat said that since the end of January when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in Vietnam, VABIOTECH researchers have been working with scientists at the Bristol University to produce a vaccine for the disease.
If the tests prove successful on mice, the research team will seek funding from international agencies to take their work further.
The company estimates it will take at least 12-18 months to develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can work safely on humans.
A vaccine is generally considered the most effective way to fight a viral disease.
There is currently no approved vaccine or medication for the Covid-19, which has infected more than five million people with reported deaths rising above 329,000.
Around 150 Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being carried out worldwide.
Eight vaccines have begun human testing.
On Monday, Moderna, the Massachusetts biotechnology company, announced promising early results from its first human safety tests on eight volunteers.
With no new case confirmed, Wednesday marked day 34 without a new coronavirus infection caused by community transmission in Vietnam.
The nation's Covid-19 tally now stands at 324.
Doctors to transfer British pilot to Chợ Rẫy Hospital before lung transplant.
The country's 91st COVID-19 patient, a British pilot, will be transferred to the intensive care centre in HCM City's Chợ Rẫy Hospital to have a lung transplant when the patient is healthy enough for the procedure.
The hospital has improved its intensive care centre to ensure the highest safety before receiving the patient for further treatment.
This was the conclusion made at a telemedicine conference of leading doctors in the country on Tuesday to find optimal ways to save the patient.
Lương Ngọc Khuê, head of the Health Ministry's Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, said the Association of Young Vietnamese Entrepreneurs and many donors were willing to cover all medical expenses of treatment and lung transplant for the patient.
Also at the meeting, the doctors said the second computed tomography (CT) scan of the critically-ill British pilot – the 91st patient – showed positive improvements.
About 20 to 30 percent of his lungs have recovered.
The patient still has to depend completely on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO).
Without the support, he will die.
If his lungs do not recover, the only way to save him is a lung transplant, Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh Châu, director of HCM City's Hospital for Tropical Diseases said.
The patient has been on ECMO for 44 days.
The patient has undergone two CT scans, one on Monday and another on May 13.
The first CT scan images on May 13 showed severe solidification and fibrosis of the lungs, making it difficult for oxygen to get into the patient's blood.
Only 10 percent of his lungs were working.
The 43-year-old male patient remains the most difficult COVID-19 case in Viet Nam, with a complicated disease progression since he was hospitalised on March 18 at HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
Viet Nam calls for special attention to COVID-19 response in Syria.
Viet Nam has called for special attention to responding to the COVID-19 epidemic which is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Syria, at a regular monthly meeting of the UN Security Council.
Addressing the May 19 video meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria, Deputy Permanent Representative of Viet Nam to the UN - Ambassador Phạm Hải Anh said humanitarian access must be maintained in all areas in Syria, and a favourable security environment be ensured for humanitarian activities.
He appealed to the international community to support Syria in this difficult time, including ensuring the supply of food and medical supplies necessary for COVID-19 prevention and control.
In his report, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock said the economic and humanitarian crisis in Syria is facing a great challenge by the risk of COVID-19 outbreak.
Though the country has so far reported only 64 cases, the local disease prevention capacity is poor.
Besides the impact of social distancing measures, the Syrian people are also facing rising inflation, with the prices of essential goods having doubled from one year ago.
Lowcock called on the international community to increase support to Syria in all possible forms.
The humanitarian crisis in Syria is the consequence of prolonged instability and conflicts during the past decade.
It is estimated that more than 11 million people in Syria need humanitarian assistance.
Uniqlo to open fourth store in Vietnam.
Japanese global apparel retailer Uniqlo has announced that it will open its newest store in Vietnam on June 5.
Located on the first floor of Vincom Center Landmark 81 in HCMC's Binh Thanh District, the store covers a total retail space of some 2,000 square meters, which is equivalent to that of its recently launched facility in the city's District 7.

Of these, three stores have been opened in HCMC and one store is in the capital city of Hanoi.
Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu to build high-tech agricultural zone.
The southern coastal province of Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu plans to set up a 1,073ha high-tech agricultural zone in the next five years.
It will come up in Châu Đức District.
It will improve productivity and quality of agricultural products, enhancing their competitiveness and enable the creation of new-style rural areas besides creating jobs and improving incomes for local people.
The project is estimated to cost around VNĐ1.32 trillion (US$56.4 million), with the money coming entirely from private investors.
Public funds would be used for building infrastructure outside the zone such as roads, water and power supply systems and drainage.
The zone will have three separate areas for farming, processing and related services.
By 2025 it is expected to generate annual revenues of VNĐ712 million ($30,500) per hectare and profits of VNĐ411 million ($17,600).
The province seeks to mechanise and modernise its agriculture by establishing high-tech agricultural firms, piloting efficient models of hi-tech use in farming and processing and building value chains from production and processing to consumption.
The proposed zone will have 114ha under flowers and vegetables, nearly 15ha under mushrooms, 622ha under fruits, and 153ha under perennial cash crops such as pepper and cacao.
A 2.75ha area will be earmarked for processing facilities and services.
Lê Tuấn Quốc, deputy chairman of the provincial People's Committee, has instructed the project's consultants to consider construction of reservoirs to store water from the Rây River to irrigate the zone.
The provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will work with the consultants unit to complete the feasibility report and submit it to the provincial authorities for approval.
Sixty one high-tech agricultural facilities are operating successfully in the province.

Ministry sounds alarm as Chinese own rights to prime land lots in Danang.
Chinese-invested firms own the rights to a large number of land lots that are of significant importance to the economy and national defense in the central city of Danang, according to the Ministry of National Defense.
As of the end of 2019, some 149 enterprises with Chinese involvement were active in 22 border cities and provinces in Vietnam.
In Danang, there were 135 coastal land lots held by Chinese-invested firms between 2011 and 2015.
These land lots are situated in prime locations, such as the city's coastal urban area.
near Nuoc Man Airport.
along the Hoang Sa and Vo Nguyen Giap streets in Khue My Ward, Ngu Hanh Son District.
and urban areas in Phuoc My and Tho Quang wards, Son Tra District.
As Vietnam does not permit foreigners to make land-use transfer transactions, many Chinese nationals have funded Vietnamese people to have them purchase land lots in Danang.
Between 2011 and 2015, Chinese and Taiwanese nationals provided money to eight Vietnamese people to buy 84 land lots covering some 20,000 square meters in total in the city.
Moreover, seven Chinese-invested firms own several coastal land lots and have leased land for 50 years.
Chinese people have also founded Chinese-Vietnamese joint ventures, with Chinese capital contributions initially below those of the Vietnamese.
However, the Chinese investors gradually increased their investment to take over the firms as well as their land.
According to the Ministry of National Defense, the prime minister has asked the relevant ministries, departments and the Danang authorities to handle individuals and organizations involved in these cases.
The ministry stated that the total capital of 149 Chinese-invested firms operating in Vietnam's border areas is nearly US$31 billion.
They are active in various fields including hospitality, catering services, entertainment, clothing, aquatic products, footwear, packaging, toys and electronic components.
All of them were founded before December 2018 and employ nearly 4,240 Chinese workers.
Most of them comply with Vietnamese laws, but some have infringed on the law, including employing Chinese workers without registration, producing drugs, polluting the environment and evading taxes.
The ministry suggested that the Government assign ministries, departments and local authorities to inspect all Chinese-invested firms and projects in border areas, tighten control over Chinese nationals' activities and amend the law to prevent Chinese nationals from taking advantage of loopholes.

Nearly 300 Vietnamese return home from Thailand.
Nearly 300 Vietnamese citizens been repatriated from Thailand May 18, because of the development of the coronavirus pandemic in the neighboring country.
The repatriation flight was operated with the cooperation of Vietnamese and Thai authorities and national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines.

Following the prime minister's directives, Vietnamese agencies at home and the representative bodies overseas will operate further repatriation flights based on the disease's development and the local quarantine capacity.
HCMC faces extreme risk of flooding by 2050.
Bloomberg on May 17 cited a report by the McKinsey Global Institute claiming that the chance of flood disasters in HCMC could increase by five to 10 times by 2050 given the rapid infrastructure expansion in the city driven by economic growth.
This would result in economic and infrastructural damage, leading to billions of dollars in losses.
The analysis is based on hydrological simulations, land-use maps, infrastructure databases and damage curves.
While the city can cope with flood risks that could affect 23% of its landscape, further urbanization will raise the potential for land subsidence and an increase in sea levels.
This could cause some US$8.4 billion worth of real-estate damage from flooding by 2050, six times the current estimated impact.
McKinsey noted that the city still has time to adapt to avoid these risks by putting better plans in place, including relocating homes and infrastructure assets away from flood-prone areas.
Investments and fundraising are also needed to reduce exposure for roads and other critical utilities, according to the report.
Vietnam is forecast to become the 20th largest economy in the world by 2050, with an annual economic growth rate of 5.1% according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Vietnam posts second fastest growth of rich population.
Vietnam ranks second among the world's top wealth markets in terms of very high net worth individuals over the past decade.
The country's average annual growth rate of those with a net worth between $5-30 million, categorized as very high net worth (VHNW) population, reached 13.9 percent during the 2010-2019 period, says Wealth-X.
This growth rate is only lower than Bangladesh at 14.3 percent, according to a recent Wealth-X report.
It attributes Vietnam's wealth performance to robust economic growth supported by a young and expanding workforce and deepening integration in regional manufacturing supply chains.
Vietnam has a workforce of over 57 million, 70 percent of which belong to the Y (commonly called millennials, born between 1976 and 1995) and Z generations (born after 1995), according to official statistics.
Last year, the Vietnamese economy expanded at 7.02 percent, the second highest in the last decade after a record 7.08 percent in 2018.
The rapid urbanization and an ongoing shift from low-productivity agriculture towards manufacturing and services in Asian economies, including Vietnam, have contributed to the growth of wealthy individuals, the report says.
China ranked third among the top 10 fastest-growing wealth markets at 13.5 percent, followed by Kenya (13.1 percent) and the Philippines (11.9 percent).
The rest of the top 10 comprised Thailand (10.6 percent), New Zealand (8.7 percent), the U.S (8.2 percent), Pakistan (7.5 percent) and Ireland (7.1 percent).
Vietnam had 25,727 millionaires last year, up 12 percent from a year ago.
Of these, 458 had a net worth of above $30 million, up 7 percent from a year ago, according to a report released earlier this year by global property consultant Knight Frank.

As the baby was big, doctors decided to do a C-section, although all her previous children had been vaginal deliveries, each born between 3.6 to 4.8 kilos.
The baby born Friday is the heaviest delivered to date at the Soc Trang hospital.
Normally, a baby born at full term weighs 2.5-4 kilos on average, said Nguyen Thi My Ha, director of the hospital.
Despite being born heavy, the baby girl's health indices were all normal, doctors said.
According to health experts, babies born abnormally heavy could face several problems including respiratory depression and hypoglycemia.
The heaviest baby delivered so far in Vietnam is a boy weighing 7.1 kilos in the northern province of Vinh Phuc in 2017.
The second heaviest one is a baby girl in the Central Highlands province of Gia Lai, born in 2008 weighing almost seven kilos.
Two other babies delivered in Da Nang and Quang Nam Province in central Vietnam weighed 6.5 kilos at birth.
Seriously ill pilot shows signs of improvement.
The 43-year-old is considered Viet Nam's most seriously ill patient and works for national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines.
He has tested negative for Covid 19 five times and doctors are preparing him to be transferred to Chợ Rẫy Hospital in HCM City for a lung transplant.
The treatment sub-committee, which is under the National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control, said that so far 260 patients have recovered from the disease, making up 82 percent of the total number of people to contract the disease in Viet Nam.
A total of 58 patients are currently being treated for coronavirus at hospitals around the country.
Most of them are in stable condition.
In another development, a delegation from the Ministry of Health (MoH) chaired by associate professor Lương Ngọc Khuê, director of the Medical Services Administration, on Saturday worked with medical staff at the Thái Bình Province General Hospital where 25 COVID-19 patients are being treated.
Experts from the MoH asked the hospital to do all they can to help the patients, give them special supervision, and regularly contact the MoH to discuss their conditions.
The most important work is preventing the disease from spreading to medical workers and other patients.
Earlier on Saturday morning, the treatment sub-committee assigned a task force team from the Hà Nội-based Bạch Mai Hospital to give professional support to the Thái Bình Province Hospital.

State should encourage casino investment to attract foreign tourists.
association.
The Viet Nam Association of Foreign Investment Enterprises (VAFIE) has proposed the Government to encourage the development of casino businesses and gambling activities in hotels and resorts to attract more foreign tourists.
The association said at present, casino and gambling activities are present in 43 hotels and resorts.
The domestic gaming and casino market has strongly developed since a full legal framework was put in place.
However, the economic efficiency of the gaming industry and casino business has not been commensurate with their potential because those are sensitive fields and there is not yet a consensus view among State agencies in attracting foreign investment to this field.
Besides that, the domestic legal system for this field has not yet approached international practices, according to the association.
One more important thing is that the Ministry of Finance does not have enough human resources for managing gambling and casino businesses, so evaluation and issuance of business registration certificates for businesses in those fields have been implemented slowly.
Therefore, the association said Viet Nam should learn in developing the gambling activities as well as casino businesses from other countries, especially Australia and Singapore, to complete the State management of developing these fields.
Specifically, the State needs to amend and complete policies and laws relating to gambling activities and casino businesses according to international practices to ensure stability and transparency for this entertainment market.
That would encourage investment from Vietnamese and foreign organisations and individuals to this market as well as attract more international tourists.
For the State management measures, according to VAFIE, the nation could establish a national council on the management of gambling activities and casino business like Singapore or allow local authorities to manage those activities like Australia.
The association has recommended Viet Nam set up a national council on the management of gambling activities and casino businesses like Singapore to directly solve problems relating to those fields.
The council is a Governmental agency headed by a deputy prime minister.
It also includes representatives from ministries, sectors and associations relating to this field as well as legal, psychological and sociological experts.
This council will give proposals to the Government on policies and solutions of managing gambling activities and casino business, including appraisal and license of investment and business projects, as well as monitoring those projects and solving problems.
That would minimise negative impacts on society and the economy.
Four men jailed for wildlife trafficking.
A court in Ca Mau Province on Thursday sentenced four men belonging to a wildlife trafficking gang to two to 13 years in jail.
Tran Quy, director of Hai Dang Company, which registered as a tourism agency, the kingpin of the ring, got 13 years.
Nguyen Hai Nam was sentenced to 12 years and Le Viet Linh to 10 years while Ngo Vu Lam got two years.
In January 2018, border troops found Dang's company transporting 113 pangolins and more than 300 kg of pangolin scales by boat in Ca Mau, and it failed to furnish legal documents for them.
Local authorities began an investigation into the company's wildlife breeding activities, and found that the animals were raised for trafficking.
Quy helped transport wildlife from abroad into Vietnam by sea before selling them for local consumption.
Trafficking of pangolins is not uncommon in Vietnam, where they are legally protected and classified as endangered.
The animals are sought after in the country and neighboring nations for their meat and the alleged medicinal properties of their scales.
In 2019, Vietnam seized 63.7 tonnes of pangolin scales, the largest volume in the world, according to the Netherlands-based Wildlife Justice Commission.
It is illegal to hunt, kill, possess, capture, transport, or trade protected animals in Vietnam, and they carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison and fines up to VND15 billion ($645,000).
Vietnam reports four new Covid-19 cases.

The 315th patient, a 39-year-old man, illegally traveled to Vietnam from Cambodia on May 2 and visited his aunt in Tay Ninh Province's Tan Chau District.
At his aunt's request, the man then showed up at a police station and was sent to a centralized center on May 3.
On May 5, he tested negative for the coronavirus, but his second test result came back positive on May 15.
The patient is being treated at Tay Ninh General Hospital, while 17 people, who had earlier come into close contact with the 315th case, are under quarantine in the province.
Another patient, confirmed as the 316th, flew back to Vietnam from the Philippines through Can Tho International Airport on May 14.
The 19-year-old man tested positive for the virus on May 15.
The resident of Danang City is receiving treatment at Sa Dec General Hospital in the Mekong Delta province of Dong Thap.
The remaining two patients, tagged as the 317th and 318th, onboard Flight VN0062 departing from Russia arrived at Van Don International Airport in Quang Ninh Province on May 13.

Vietnam mounts all-out effort to save the most critically ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot.
Vietnam has mounted an all-out effort to save the life of its most critically ill novel coronavirus patient, a British pilot who works for Vietnam Airlines, the national carrier.
Through aggressive testing and a mass, centralised quarantine programme, the Southeast Asian country has kept its tally of coronavirus cases to just 288 and has reported no deaths.
The 43-year-old man, identified only as Patient 91, who caught the coronavirus at a bar in the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City in mid-March.
More than 4,000 people connected to the cluster were tested, with 18 of them found to be infected with the coronavirus.
While most have recovered, the British pilot is on life support and his condition has deteriorated significantly.
On Tuesday, the health ministry held a meeting with experts from top hospitals and decided that the only way to save the man's life was with a lung transplant.
His case has garnered national spotlight in Vietnam, where the government has won broad support for its campaign to contain the coronavirus.
On Thursday, state media said 10 people, including a 70-year-old military veteran, had volunteered themselves as lung donors, but had been turned down by state doctors.
We are touched by their good intentions, but current regulations don't allow us to transplant lungs donated by most living people, a representative of the Vietnam National Coordinating Centre for Human Organ Transplantation (VNHOT) told the Tuoi Tre newspaper.
The patient has just 10% of his lung capacity left and has been on life support for more than 30 days, Tuoi Tre said.
Deputy health minister Nguyen Truong Son told media last month that Vietnam had imported specialist medicine from overseas to treat blood clots in the patient, but to no avail.
Vietnam has spent more than 5 billion dong ($200,000) trying to save him, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.
In March, Chinese state media said it had successfully carried out a double lung transplant on a coronavirus patient, a procedure it hailed as a significant method of treating the disease's most stricken victims.
Vietnam is hoping to capitalise on its success fighting the coronavirus by positioning itself as a safe place to do business as international manufacturers look to diversify their supply chains away from China.
Vietnam's coronavirus cases rise to 312 cases.
Vietnam reported 24 new coronavirus cases today, May 15, all of whom are Vietnamese returning from Russia, taking the country's total number of confirmed cases to 312, according to the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control.
One of the patients is female and 23 others are male, aged between 24 and 48.
They returned to Quang Ninh Province on Vietnam Airlines flight VN0062 on May 13, together with 321 other passengers.
All of them and crew members were sent to quarantine centers in Thai Binh, Quang Ninh and Hai Duong provinces after their arrival.
The 23 new patients were taken to Thai Binh General Hospital for treatment while the remaining one case was hospitalized at Quang Ninh Hospital No 2, the local media reported.
Vung Tau Airport to be rebuilt into urban area.
After being relocated to Go Gang Island, the existing Vung Tau Airport in the city center will be developed into an urban area.
The standing board of the Party Committee of Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province has met with representatives of a consortium comprising Van Phu-Invest Investment JSC and VCI Investment JSC, and of consulting firms to discuss the development of Hai Dang new urban area and another residential area at the existing airport in Vung Tau City.
The provincial government stated that the consortium had earlier written to the province seeking approval to study and invest in Go Gang Airport in Long Son Commune.
Besides this, the two firms proposed developing the two residential areas.
As for the Vung Tau airport, which covers some 172 hectares of land, the consortium proposed building a new urban area comprising a 35-hectare compact city, a 46-hectare central park, a 24-hectare transit and trading service complex, a 20-hectare financial and technology center and a 25-hectare complex.
The standing board praised the idea, calling on the consortium to carefully assess the density of the population, the number of vehicles and the traffic flow at the projected area to work out a solution for traffic connections and the construction of parking lots.
Apart from this, the consortium should reconsider the feasibility of constructing a financial center, the standing board said, suggesting gathering branches of banks in the province at the center.
Many urban traffic experts threw their support behind the relocation of Vung Tau Airport to Go Gang Island, pointing out that moving the airport from the city center would contribute to the establishment of new urban areas in both parts of Vung Tau.
Three get death for drug trafficking.
The Ha Tinh People's Court sentenced 29-year-old Hoang Ngoc Tan to death after he was caught carrying six packs of heroin from Huong Son District in the province to Ho Chi Minh City.
The drug was found in his motorbike trunk on October 7 last year by border guards.
Tan told the court that in September, he had been asked by a stranger on a social network to buy heroin in Laos and transport it to HCMC.
Tan was promised VND70 million ($3,000) for the job.
The heroin was brought into Vietnam via the Laos border.
In Nghe An, local 45-year-old Hoang Nghia Van and 37-year-old Cho Mua from Bolikhamsai Province in Laos were also sentenced to death for trafficking drugs.
Mua Ba Va, 32, of the province's Ky Son District, was sentenced to life for the same crime.
In March 2019, Van had met a woman named Nguyen Thi Ly in HCMC.
Ly asked Van to buy drugs when he returned to Nghe An and promised to pay him VND17 million if he succeeded.
A month later, Van returned to Nghe An and stayed there until May 9.
Then he went to Bolikhamsai in Laos to marry a woman and he met Cho Mua, a relative of his wife.
Cho Mua agreed to purchase drugs for Van.
After the wedding, Van returned to Vietnam and informed Ly that he has found a source.
Ly said she would send Van VND2 billion to buy 15 kilos of ketamine.
On May 27, Van received the money from Ly and gave it to Cho Mua, who used it to purchase the ketamine from a Laotian.
Mua hired Va to transport the drugs for $2,000.
After receiving the drugs in the forest, Mua rode a motorbike carrying Va, who was holding the packages in the back.
The two were caught in Huong Son District, Ha Tinh Province.
Van was arrested as he waited for Mua to deliver the ketamine to him.
Police have not been able to find and verify the identity of Nguyen Thi Ly.
Vietnam is a key trafficking hub for drugs from the Golden Triangle, an intersection of Laos, Thailand and Myanmar and the world's second largest drug producing area after the Golden Crescent in South Asia.
Vietnam has some of the harshest punishments for drug trafficking, awarding death to those convicted of possessing or smuggling over 600 grams of heroin or more than 2.5 kg of methamphetamine and to those producing or selling 100 grams of heroin or 300 grams of other illegal narcotics.
However this does not seem to have had a deterrent effect, with increasing drug trafficking cases coming to light in recent years.
Su Ngoc Khuong, senior director of real estate service firm Savills Vietnam, said Vietnam's political stability and fast economic growth are positive factors for drawing foreign investment.
A recent report by real estate service firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) shows that Vietnam's industrial land prices rose by up to 12 percent year-on-year in the first quarter despite pandemic impacts.
Industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and therefore land prices are expected to increase in line with the long-term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, said Stephen Wyatt, country head of JLL Vietnam.
Most industrial land developers have posted strong numbers in the first quarter despite the pandemic.
VNDIRECT analysts said that Vietnam was ready to become an alternative manufacturing hub to China, adding that the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau and the northern provinces of Bac Giang and Hai Duong could become new industrial hotspots thanks to improved infrastructure.
Prolonged heatwave expected.
A heatwave affecting many parts of Vietnam is expected to continue, with temperatures reaching as high as 35-38 degrees Celsius.
The National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting (NCHMF) forecast that hot weather will hit northern Vietnam between May 15 and 16 with a maximum temperature of 36 degrees Celsius.
The heatwave is also expected to envelop the northern mountainous areas and the central region, where high temperatures could reach some 35-38 degrees Celsius, or even higher in some places.
The temperature is predicted to stay above 35 degrees Celsius from 11 a.m to 4 p.m.
The hot weather sweeping central localities will likely last until May 21, stated NCHMF.
In the Central Highlands and southern regions, high temperatures of 35-37 degrees Celcius are expected today, May 15.
The widespread heatwave may end in these regions around May 16.
Similarly, the capital city of Hanoi will endure the scorching heat until May 17.
The impact of hot temperatures coupled with low humidity and the southwest monsoon will pose a high risk of fire and explosions in residential areas due to a rising demand for power, as well as forest fires in the central provinces and northern mountainous region.
Besides this, hot weather can lead to many health problems such as dehydration, heat exhaustion and heat stroke due to prolonged exposure to high temperatures.
Israeli company uncovers cyberattack on Vietnam, neighbors by China-linked group​.
A ransomware attack targeting government systems in Vietnam and several neighboring countries has been discovered by an Israeli cybersecurity firm.
Check Point Research said in a report last Thursday the cyber espionage operation has been going on under the radar for years and is connected to Naikon Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group, which cybersecurity firms like Kaspersky, ThreatConnect and Defense Group exposed in 2015 as having links to China.
The group's goal is to gather geo-political intelligence from government entities in Vietnam, Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Brunei, and the Philippines.
Its specific targets are ministries of foreign affairs and science and technology besides government-owned companies.
For instance, the group disguised one of its attacks as an email sent from a government embassy in Asia Pacific to the Australian government.
Inside the malicious email was a file called The Indians Way.doc containing the backdoor Trojan, Aria-body.
Check Point said the Trojan can not only locate and collect specific documents from infected computers and networks in government departments, but also extract data from removable drives, take screenshots and log keys, and of course harvest the stolen data for espionage.
Vietnam cybersecurity company VSEC said Naikon still uses the popular attack method of sending a decoy email with a malicious file.
When the victim opens the email, the computer automatically installs the malware, helping hackers collect information, steal sensitive documents and attack other computers in the same system and elsewhere.
Naikon also turns victims' malware-infected devices and servers into a C2 server to launch new attacks targeting other government agencies.
Truong Duc Luong, a VSEC cybersecurity expert, said Naikon's return represents new threats to cybersecurity since it has likely silently studied and developed new, sophisticated and more dangerous attacks during the last five years.
In the past hacker group APT30 also used malicious software to access computers containing important political, economic and military intelligence in Asia, mainly Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and India.
The espionage campaign lasted 10 years before being discovered by security company FireEye in 2015.
The Department of Information Security said in the first four months of this year it recorded a total of 1,056 cyberattacks on Vietnam, a 51.4 percent year-on-year drop.
24 repatriates are Vietnam's latest Covid-19 patients.
Vietnam's Covid-19 tally jumped to 312 Friday morning after 24 citizens repatriated from Russia were confirmed positive.
Friday morning marked 29 days straight that Vietnam has gone without any cases caused by community transmission.
Russia is the third worst infected country, after the U.S and Spain, with more than 252,000 Covid-19 cases and 2,305 deaths.
But Vietnam health authorities have confirmed there is no likelihood of community transmission from the latest patients.
The 24, one woman and 23 men, aged between 24 and 47, had returned to Vietnam on Vietnam Airlines flight VN0062 from Russia to the northern province of Quang Ninh on Wednesday under a government program to repatriate Vietnamese residents living and working abroad.
They had been quarantined on arrival at centralized facilities in the provinces of Quang Ninh, Thai Binh and Hai Duong.
Twenty-three of the latest patients are now treated at the Thai Binh General Hospital and the other at Hospital No.2 in Quang Ninh Province.
With many special repatriation flights planned, the country will continue its focus on those arriving from abroad.
Everyone entering the country will be placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days, the period said to be the incubation time for the Covid-19 virus.
As of Friday, no Covid-19 death has been reported in the country.
The health sector is searching for a matching donor to provide a lung transplant for the most critical Covid-19 case in the country, a 43-year-old British man whose lungs are just 10 percent functional.
The pandemic has affected 213 countries and territories, killing more than 303,000 people.
PM permits re-opening of sub-border gates with China.
The Prime Minister has allowed the re-opening of sub-border gates and border crossings to resume trading activities between Việt Nam and China, according to the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
The permission has been issued according to the proposals from the ministry and people's committees of Lạng Sơn and Quảng Ninh provinces on restoring those activities to get back to normal at border gates between the two countries.
They include Bình Nghi, Na Hình, Nà Nưa, Pò Nhùng and Bắc Phong Sinh sub-border gates and Ka Long border crossing.
Meanwhile, the PM has also allowed the people's committees of border provinces to actively resume operation of other sub-border gates and border check-points in those provinces based on the local situation and the Government's existing regulations on management of land border gates and border trade activities.
The localities only re-open the sub-border gates that have large volume of goods at those gates, especially agricultural and aquatic products for export and imported raw materials for domestic production which are permitted to trade via the border gates by the local authorities of the two sides.
The PM has also requested those provinces to ensure control and prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic for people and vehicles engaged in import and export activities under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and other relevant State offices.
Ten Vietnamese offer to donate lungs for British pilot.
As of this morning, May 14, as many as Vietnamese people have contacted the Vietnam National Coordinating Center for Human Organ Transplantation offering to donate lungs to the critically ill 91st coronavirus case, a 43-year-old British pilot.
The pilot was hospitalized on March 18 and remains the most critical Covid-19 case in Vietnam.
Experts said a lung transplant is the last chance to save him.
Lung ultrasound scans on May 13 showed that both his lungs have suffered extensive damage and only 10% of his lungs can function.
Luong Ngoc Khue, director of the Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, noted that the man is 1.83 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms, so it is hard to find suitable organs for a lung transplant.
The difference in size between the donated organ and the patient's organ should not exceed 20%, not to mention immunity and other biochemical factors, he explained.
Doctors plan to transfer him from the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases to Cho Ray Hospital.
Once an organ that meets size, immunity and biochemical requirements is found, doctors from Vietnam-Germany Hospital and other hospitals that have successfully performed lung transplants will perform the operation.
A representative of the Vietnam National Coordinating Center for Human Organ Transplantation noted that the donated organs, including whole lungs or parts of lungs, must come from a brain-dead person.
For a living donor, the person must be the pilot's relative.
According to the Ministry of Health, British authorities recently contacted the patient's aunt.
The pilot is single and it is unknown whether his parents are alive.
Meanwhile, national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines told the ministry that the man was not its official pilot but worked for the airline through an aviation human resource company.

Traffic police to make random inspections from May 15.
Traffic police nationwide will have the right to stop any driver to check their vehicle registration certificate, driving license, vehicle insurance, certificate of technical safety and environmental protection and other vehicle documents from May 15 to June 14.
The campaign was introduced by the Traffic Police Department to ensure safety and order as traffic in the country has worsened after social distancing measures and travel restrictions were removed.
Any motorbike, car, bus, coach, or container truck can be stopped for inspection, according to Thanh Nien newspaper.
Traffic police will also focus on handling traffic violations such as exceeding speed limits, driving in the wrong direction, not wearing a helmet, running red lights, recklessly overtaking and driving under the influence of alcohol.
The police will use handheld cameras or vehicle dash cams to record violations, which will be used as proof when determining penalties.
When performing breath alcohol tests, traffic police have to follow the instructions of the ministries of Public Security and Health to ensure safety and hygiene.
Breath alcohol testers must be carefully sanitized, and each breath pipe can only be used by one person.
Chinese man gets death for killing Vietnamese mother-in-law.
A Chinese man was sentenced to death Tuesday in the southern province of Tay Ninh for murdering his Vietnamese mother-in-law.
Xiong Zhoughen, 39, killed Vo Thi Mong Diep in a heated fight last year.
In 2018, Zhougen had married Diep's daughter and the couple had moved to China.
His wife later returned to Vietnam and began living with her mother in May last year.
The following month, Zhougen traveled to Vietnam and lived with his wife and mother-in-law for a few days before asking Diep for money to return home to China.
Diep said she had no money and asked Zhougen to leave.
A verbal fight then escalated into a physical one, between Diep and Zhongen.
Zhougen then hit Diep repeatedly in the head and face with a hammer before using a knife to slit her throat until she lay motionless.
Zhougen tried to escape after the murder, but was apprehended later.
Hà Nội provides medical supplies to help Moscow cope with COVID-19.
On behalf of the Party organisation, administration and people of Hà Nội, Chairman of the city People's Committee Nguyễn Đức Chung presented medical supplies to the Russian capital of Moscow and the Vietnamese community in the country on Tuesday, in support of efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the handover ceremony, Hà Nội presented 100,000 antibacterial cloth face masks and 50,000 medical face masks to Moscow, along with another 50,000 masks to the Vietnamese Embassy and Vietnamese community in Russia.
Chairman Chung said all countries are making every effort to contain the pandemic but none can single-handedly deal with the problem.
Based on the Việt Nam-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership and the traditional friendship between the two capitals, the Party organisation, administration and people of Hà Nội wish to share some of their resources with Moscow's administration and people in the fight against COVID-19, he noted.
For his part, Russian Ambassador to Việt Nam Konstantin Vnukov said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Việt Nam and the country's Government, necessary measures have been adopted to curb the pandemic and Việt Nam is now among the best performers in combating COVID-19.
On behalf of the Moscow administration and people, he thanked Hà Nội for the gifts.
Court upholds 17-year prison sentence for former Danang leader in illicit land acquisition.
On Tuesday, the High-level People's Court of Hanoi City delivered its rulings on the appeals by the 64-year-old Minh.
his successor Van Huu Chien, 66.Phan Van Anh Vu, 44, who was the chairman of Bac Nam 79 Construction JSC.
and 17 other defendants.
The panel of judges dismissed the appeals of Minh and Vu, who were found guilty of breaking regulations on the management and use of State properties, leading to losses and wastefulness, and those on land management.
Having taken the case's evidence and their testimonies into account, the higher court said the first-instance verdicts against the duo were based on reasonable, lawful and just grounds.
Therefore, Minh and Vu will spend 17 and 30 years, respectively, behind bars for the two charges.
Meanwhile, Chien, who served as the Danang leader between 2011 and 2016, had his sentence commuted by two years to 10 years, due to his efforts to recover part of the damage.
They were found to have caused a total loss of some VND22 trillion (US$945 million) for the State through the transfer of 22 public housing and land complexes and seven real estate projects.
The higher court stated there were sufficient grounds to prove Minh was the key individual who developed the policy to transfer these public properties and had directed Chien and others accused in the case to commit the criminal act.
The first-instance verdicts, which concluded that Minh and Chien had played major roles in the case, were lawful, according to the judges.
At the appellate court, the former business mogul Vu appealed against the entire first-instance verdict, claiming that he had no close relationship with the city's leaders and thus ruled out the chance that he could have been their accomplice.
However, the higher court determined that Vu had a close relationship with the former leaders, so the charges against him were appropriate.
Vu moonlighted as an operative for the General Department of Intelligence with the Ministry of Public Security in 2009 and left the organization in 2017.
During that time, he abused his position and urged the ministry's then-leaders enabled him to buy and transfer many State-owned plots of land in prime locations.
Ex-chairman Minh was aware that Vu was not eligible to purchase these properties but still gave him the go-ahead to do so.
Minh and his subordinates were found guilty of having granted Vu a number of unlawful privileges, such as property handover at concessional prices without going through the due process of an auction.
For the remaining 17 defendants, their prison sentences were either reduced to between one and six years or became noncustodial sentences.
Many countries have banned plastic bags.
It is not able to deny the convenience of plastic bags, but the overuse of plastic bags and the lack of the waste disposal methods have damaged our environment.
Now, plastic bags are the enemy of human beings and the environment.
Since October, beside supermarkets, confectioneries are also prohibited to provide free plastic bags to customers in Korea.
In Australia, the supermarket chain Coles has started offering free eco-friendly bags for one month since the beginning of this month, with the purpose of helping customers adjust their shopping habits and preparing for stopping using plastic bags in the future.
Meanwhile, the Constitutional Court of Chile has approved has ratified a bill to ban the use of plastic bags in businesses, paving the way for it to become the first country in Latin America to adopt the environmental protection measure.
EU, France back Vietnam in fight against climate change.
The European Union and the French Development Agency (AFD) have established a 20-million-euro ($21.5 million) fund to help Vietnam deal with climate change.
The EU will provide the money as a non-refundable grant to the AFD to run the fund.
The latter will, in turn, provide loans for strategic projects in Vietnam to improve the management of water and other resources and respond to challenges like floods and coastal erosion that climate change exacerbates.
EU ambassador to Vietnam, Giorgio Aliberti, who signed an agreement for the fund with Fabrice Richy, director of AFD, in Vietnam on Monday, said.
Adaptation to climate change is crucial for the sustainability of Vietnam's development, and water and natural resources are a key element of it.
The intention of the new 20-million-euro grant is to support Vietnam on a pathway towards a greener and resilient future and enhance natural resources management that will help restore and preserve ecosystems and boost the resilience of the local population.
According to the World Bank, 70 percent of the country's population are vulnerable to typhoons, floods, droughts, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, landslides, forest fires, and occasional earthquakes.
The risks are exacerbated by climate change.
Floods and storms account for more than 40 percent of all-natural disasters.
Vietnam is one of six economies most affected by climate change between 1999 and 2018, according to the Global Climate Risk Index published last year by German environmental think tank Germanwatch.
Rising temperatures and sea levels, and the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events combined with population growth and urbanization are increasing the risk of coastal erosion, urban flooding and drought.
This year saltwater intruded 50-110 kilometers into major rivers in the Mekong Delta, even deeper than in 2016, which was considered a very bad year.
Six delta provinces, Tien Giang, Ben Tre, Long An, Kien Giang, Ca Mau, and Soc Trang have declared an emergency over the salinity.
Senior Vietnam Expressway Corporation official arrested.
A deputy general director of state-run Vietnam Expressway Corporation was arrested Monday over violations in managing the Da Nang – Quang Ngai Expressway project.
Le Quang Hao was arrested by the Ministry of Public Security's investigative police department for construction law violations that led to serious consequences.
Hao is said to be responsible for not following procedures, standards and design requirements in overseeing inspection of a 65-kilometer section of the expressway, which resulted in poor project quality.
Fourteen other people including employees of the corporation, the country's biggest expressway builder, members of the project management board and staff of other companies have also been arrested in the case.
Reports about poor construction quality of the expressway, the first expressway in the country's central region that connects Da Nang City and Quang Ngai Province, first surfaced in 2018 after it developed cracks and potholes.
Construction of the expressway had begun in 2013.
A part of it was opened to traffic in 2017 and it became fully operational in September the following year.
However, just a month after the opening, cracks and potholes were seen in the aftermath of a heavy downpour in the area.
These were hundreds of square centimeters wide and 5-10 centimeters deep.
The expressway cost over VND 34.5 trillion ($1.4 billion) to build.
China's East Sea fishing ban invalid agriculture ministry.
Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development Monday rejected China's ban on fishing in Vietnamese sea territory.
The ministry said the ban is invalid and directed provinces and cities to encourage fishermen to continue with their activities within Vietnam's territorial waters.
They should also guide groups and teams to support fishermen at sea, it said in a statement.
The East Sea is internationally known as the South China Sea.
The ministry said fishing vessels with licenses valid until the end of this year can fish in the Tonkin Gulf common fishing area, but asked them to avoid the area east of the Tonkin Gulf delimitation line.
The ministry has also requested local authorities to strengthen the management and supervision of fishing activities and monitor fishing vessels' departure actively during this period, adding that the hotline of the Department of Fisheries Control will be available for emergencies.
On April 30, the Hainan Provincial Department of Agriculture announced that China's annual fishing ban on the South China Sea has begun on May 1 and would last until August 16, Chinese news agency Xinhua reported, citing the South China Sea branch of the China Coast Guard.
The ban would apply to certain sea areas of the South China Sea that encompass parts of the Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam's Hoang Sa (Paracel) Islands.
No fishing activities are allowed in sea areas under China's sovereignty within the time period, except in certain cases, according to the Hainan department.
During the ban, China would perform safety checks for fishing equipment and vessels, as well as instruct its fisherpeople on relevant policies and skills, it said.
The Vietnam Fisheries Society has opposed China's unilateral decision, saying the fishing ban has no legal value oversea areas under Vietnam's sovereignty.
Four days later, Vietnam's Foreign Ministry also expressed clear opposition and asked Beijing not to complicate the situation further.
Vietnam has full legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) Islands, as well as its legal rights over its waters in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said.
China had seized the Paracel Islands from South Vietnam by force in 1974, and has been illegally occupying it since.
In 2012 it established the so-called Sansha City.
The city also covers a number of reefs in the Spratly Islands that China seized by force in 1988 as well as the Scarborough Shoal.
France to import hundreds of millions of masks from Việt Nam.
France has announced it would import hundreds of millions of antibacterial cloth masks from Việt Nam by air.
Accordingly, around 50 direct flights from Việt Nam to international airport Roissy-Charles de Gaulle in Paris will be operated until the end of May for the mask deliveries.
According to Tuổi trẻ (Youth) newspaper, Patrick Martin, president of the French Employers Association, said French businesses have been rushing to buy masks at high prices.
They must prepare the masks before citizens return to work under the newly announced easing of the country's lockdown.
It was estimated that France would need 250 million masks each month while the country could only produce 40 million.
They therefore have to import masks to meet demand.
RTL Radio said made-in-Việt Nam masks would be given to students, police officers and civil servants, as well as being sold at pharmacies.
The transport and logistics group Bolloré Logistics would take responsibility to bring the masks to France quickly.
The company is expected to organise two flights a day to transport the masks.
Commune Party secretary commits murder for insurance fraud.
Do Van Minh, 49, Party secretary of Lien Ha Commune in Lam Dong Province, has been accused of murdering his nephew-in-law and staging what looks like a fatal accident to illegally gain VND18 billion in insurance payouts.
Speaking at a press briefing today, May 11, the Dak Nong police noted that during their preliminary investigation after arresting the culprit the previous day, Minh had admitted to purchasing life insurance with an annual premium of over VND200 million in early April.
Upon his death, his family members would be paid VND18 billion by the insurance company.
Having incurred a debt of over VND10 billion, Minh decided to fake his death, so his wife and children could receive the insurance payout.
Minh owns two farms in Dak G'Long District in Dak Nong Province, which he visits on Fridays and Saturdays.
On May 3, Minh visited the farm of his nephew in law Tran Nho Vuong in Dak Nong Province, where he ate dinner.
At 5 a.m the next day, Minh killed the 25-year-old man with a hammer.
He then transported his nephew-in-law's body in a pickup truck on National Highway 28 in Dak G'Long District, crashed into a roadside pillar and used gasoline to set the vehicle and the deceased on fire to stage an accident.
Minh then fled the scene to Dong Xoai City, Binh Phuoc Province, the local media reported.
The Dak Nong police have yet to determine the level of involvement of his family members in the incident.
On May 4, the wreckage of the pickup truck and its burned occupant were found on National Highway 28.
Minh was arrested in Binh Phuoc Province on May 10.
Doctors discuss lung transplant for Covid-19 infected British pilot.
Doctors from Vietnam's top hospitals are considering moving a Covid-19-infected British pilot, who remains in critical condition, from HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases to Cho Ray Hospital, also in the city, for a possible lung transplant operation.
The 43-year-old Vietnam Airlines pilot was hospitalized on March 18 and remains the most critical Covid-19 case in Vietnam.
He tested negative for the coronavirus, which causes Covid-19, several times during treatment but then tested positive again a few days later.
Lung ultrasound scans showed that both his lungs have suffered extensive damage, according to the Ministry of Health, and he is reportedly experiencing cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system, causing it to attack even healthy cells and organs.
During more than 50 days in treatment, he has been on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine for 34 days as his lungs are unable to function fully.
He is also resistant to all coagulant drugs currently in use in the country, so the Ministry of Health had to order rare drugs from abroad for his treatment.
The doctors noted that he is 1.83 meters tall and weighs 100 kilograms, with a body mass index of 30.1, so he is slightly obese.
Luong Ngoc Khue, director of the Department of Medical Examination and Treatment, under the Ministry of Health, said that due to the patient's weight, it is hard to find suitable organs for a lung transplant.
The difference in size between the donated organ and the patient's organ should not exceed 20%, not to mention immunity and other biochemical factors, he said.
The Ministry of Health has asked the Vietnam National Coordinating Center for Human Organ Transplantation to work with Cho Ray Hospital, HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the Central Lung Hospital, and other hospitals that have successfully performed lung transplants such as 103 Hospital, 108 Hospital, and Vietnam-Germany Hospital to prepare for the patient's lung transplant.
Ministry to set up research group on cryptocurrency to tighten management.
The Ministry of Finance has decided to set up a research group which would be in charge of studying and proposing policies to manage virtual assets and crypto currencies.
The group had nine members, lead by Phạm Hồng Sơn, deputy chairman of the State Securites Commission.
Other members are from the State Securities Commission, the General Department of Taxation, State Bank of Việt Nam's Department of Banking and Financial Institutions and Legal Department, Việt Nam Customs and the National Institute for Việt Nam Finance.
Policies to effectively manage virtual assets were crucial in the context that virtual assets were developing rapidly but posing risks and might cause negative impacts on the market.
On August 21, 2017, the Prime Minister issued Decision No 1255/QĐ-TTg to approve the project about completing the legal framework for managing virtual assets, crypto currencies and electronic currencies.
On April 11, 2018, Directive No 10/CT-TT was issued with the aim to enhance management on transactions related to Bitcoin and other crypto currencies to put it under control and minimise their negative impacts.
Governor of the State Bank of Việt Nam on April 13, 2018 issued Directive No 02/CT-NHNN about measures to strengthen control over transactions related to crypto currencies in which credit institutions were asked not to supply some types of transactions related to virtual currencies to ensure compliance with established regulations about anti-money laundering and forex management.
According to crypto currrency market research company CrytoCompare, at the end of November 2017, about 80 per cent of Bitcoin transactions were found to originate from Asia, mainly from China, Japan, Republic of Korea and Việt Nam.
Access from Việt Nam to crypto currency websites and trading platforms were in the top five highest in the world, beside the US, Russia and Japan.
Bruce Jones, co-founder and CEO of Triton Submarines, remarked, The Triton DeepView 24 with its panoramic views represents a quantum leap forward in submarine technology, providing a vastly improved, fully immersive guest experience.
The Triton DeepView 24 submarine was assembled at Triton's manufacturing facility in Barcelona, where it successfully passed sea trials in March, according to DailyMail.
Hue offers 50% discount on sightseeing fees to stimulate tourism.
The central province of Thua Thien-Hue has approved a post-Covid-19 tourism stimulation program, offering up to 50% discounts on entrance tickets to visit world heritage sites from now to July 31, 2020, among other tourist incentives.
The new pricing was announced by Nguyen Van Phuc, Deputy Director of the Thua Thien-Hue Department of Tourism, following a meeting of the provincial People's Council on May 8.
During the meeting, tourism figures were discussed.
In January, the province's tourism industry reported the number of arrivals and revenue had year-on-year growth of 22.07% and 14.89%, respectively.
However, the coronavirus outbreak has had a heavy impact on the industry.
Many of travel companies, hotels, restaurants and shops have had to temporarily suspend their businesses, and thousands of industry workers have lost their jobs.
In the first four months of this year, the province attracted 940,069 tourists, down 50% year-on-year.
The direct tourism revenue was VND859 billion, a decrease of 21%, while the combined revenue was VND2,079 billion, down 45%, as Thua Thien-Hue lost some VND2,250 billion in tourism revenue.
Thus, apart from solutions to support enterprises suffering from the downturn caused by the epidemic, it is necessary to put in place the tourism stimulation program.
On Vietnam's Reunification Day (April 30) and May Day, thanks to free-of-charge offers for visiting world heritage sites, the province attracted 22,000 tourists following the social-distancing period.
Due to the promising results, the province decided to discount entrance fees by 50% from May 8 to July 31 this year.
The promotion might continue into the remainder of 2020, depending upon the world's tourism recovery.
The provincial tourism industry also encourages tourism companies to provide their own stimulation packages to attract more tourists.
At the meeting, leaders also discussed the national travel summit, to be held in Thua Thien-Hue later this month to seek collaboration among hotels, travel companies and restaurants, as well as cooperation by three central localities, including Quang Nam Province and Danang City.
Officials noted that tourist promotions will be held this year and next year, including Festival Hue 2020, Hue Ao dai Festival and Hue Hiphop Festival.
China reports first coronavirus case in Wuhan since April 3 among 14 new infections.
China's National Health Commission reported 14 new confirmed coronavirus cases on May 9, the highest number since April 28.
Jilin officials on Sunday raised the Shulan city risk level to high from medium after one woman tested positive on May 7.
The 11 new cases made public on Sunday are members of her family or people who came into contact with her or family members.
The new Wuhan case, the first reported in the epicentre of China's outbreak since April 3, was previously asymptomatic, according to the health commission.
Aside from the Shulan cluster and the Wuhan case, the remaining two new confirmed cases were imported infections.
It also said newly discovered asymptomatic cases were at 20, the highest since May 1 and up from 15 a day earlier.
No new deaths were reported, it said.
The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in mainland China reached 82,901 as of May 9, while the total death toll from the virus stood at 4,633, according to the commission.
Vietnamese professor wins Europe math prize.
Prof. Phan Thanh Nam has become the first Vietnamese professor to win the European Mathematical Society (EMS) prize.
Prof. Nam, 35, is a former student of the National University of HCMC.
He is currently a math professor at the Ludwig Maximillian University in Munich, Germany.
Nam's research interests include mathematical physics analysis, especially multi-particle quantum mechanics, spectral theory, variational calculation, derivative equations and calculus.
Before becoming a professor in Germany, Nam was an assistant professor in Masaryk, Czech Republic and a member of Austria's Science and Technology Society.
He has been invited twice to address the International Convention of Mathematical Physics.
In 2018, he was awarded a prize by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) for his work in mathematical physics research.
The EMS prizes are considered the second most prestigious mathematics award after the Field Medal of the International Mathematical Union (IMU).
Since established in 1992, the EMS prizes are awarded every four years at the European Congress of Mathematics (ECM).
At each ECM up to ten EMS prizes are awarded to young researchers not older than 35 years, who are European citizens or working in Europe, in recognition of excellent contributions in mathematics.
This year, the prize-giving ceremony will not be held as usual at the European Congress of Mathematics (ECM) because of the Covid-19 pandemic.
It has been postponed until June 2021.
Two Dong Nai senior cops with greased palms disciplined.
On May 8, Dong Nai Police decided to take the disciplinary action of transferring Lt. Col. Pham Hai Cang (Team 2 vice-captain) and Lt. Col. Phan Cam Tu (Team 1 vice-captain) out of the traffic department to the mobile police unit for letting vehicles violating traffic regulations to go free.
Two Dong Nai traffic cops accused their superiors, Cang and Tu, of frequently letting violators off the hook because they have paid the team.
According to a traffic police captain who had worked with Team 2 of the Dong Nai Police Department, the unit responsible for patrolling National Highway 20 that connects the province with the Central Highlands' Da Lat Town, his patrol had arrested overloaded vehicles many times, only for superiors to let them go because they had paid.
Just minutes after they made the arrest, a leader of Team 2 would call, name the registration number of the overloaded vehicle, and order the patrol team to let it go.
Two months later, Cang and Tu were suspended from work.
After verification of the allegations, Major General Nguyen Ngoc Hieu, Deputy Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Public Security, had said that there are reasons to believe that the two senior cops were guilty.
Vietnam busts $858 mln online gambling ring, 21 arrested.
An online gambling ring worth VND20 trillion ($858.3 million) was busted by the Ministry of Public Security Wednesday, leading to 21 arrests.
The ring, led by 28-year-old Nguyen Thi Huong Ly and 24-year-old Nguyen Duc Manh, utilized online gambling methods under the guise of games like poker and lottery, the ministry said.
The ring had servers overseas and cooperated with several clients inside Vietnam.
The clients in Vietnam used phone numbers and social media for players to contact and transact with them.
Players transferred cash into bank accounts provided by the clients, or paid through top-up cards.
Ly was in charge of creating clients' accounts on the ring's website for players to perform transactions.
She traveled from Hanoi to Saigon last month to rent a location for her accomplices.
She and Manh guided several people in using their personal bank accounts to perform transactions and play the games on offer.
The total amount of money transacted by the gambling ring since January last year amounted to around VND20 trillion, police said.
Ly, Manh, and 18 others were arrested by police in Hanoi and Saigon on Wednesday.
Vietnam has relaxed its stance on gambling as a social evil, legalizing sports betting in 2017 and allowing, on a pilot basis, people aged over 21 with a monthly income of at least VND10 million ($432) to play in a casino on the southern Phu Quoc Island.
But all other forms of gambling remain illegal.
Women leaders are handling the pandemic brilliantly.
Why aren't there more of them?
In Taiwan, early intervention measures have controlled the coronavirus pandemic so successfully that it is now exporting millions of face masks to help the European Union and others.
Germany has overseen the largest-scale coronavirus testing program in Europe, conducting 350,000 tests each week, detecting the virus early enough to isolate and treat patients effectively.
In New Zealand, the prime minister took early action to shut down tourism and impose a month-long lockdown on the entire country, limiting coronavirus casualties to just four deaths.
All three places have received accolades for their impressive handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
They are scattered across the globe.
one is in the heart of Europe, one is in Asia and the other is in the South Pacific.
But they have one thing in common.
they're all led by women.
The success of these and other women-led governments in dealing with a global pandemic is all the more noteworthy, given that women make up less than 7% of world leaders.
These countries -- all multi-party democracies with high levels of public trust in their governments -- have contained the pandemic through early, scientific intervention.
They have implemented widespread testing, easy access to quality medical treatment, aggressive contact tracing and tough restrictions on social gatherings.
It's too early to say definitively which leaders will emerge as having taken enough of the right steps to control the spread of coronavirus -- and save lives.
But the examples above show that a disproportionately large number of leaders who acted early and decisively were women.
Amid a severe heat wave, consistently high UV levels have been threatening major Vietnamese cities, with the index jumping to 'dangerous level' this weekend.
Data from Weather Online, a U.K.-based meteorological services provider, indicate the index in Ho Chi Minh City would climb to a 'very high' level of 10 on Saturday and 11 on Sunday, a dangerous level posing health risks to holiday-goers engaged in outdoor activities.
American forecast services provider AccuWeather said the city's UV would reach 9, also a very high level, on Saturday and 12 on Sunday.
Data from Weather Online also showed the UV index in Da Nang City in central Vietnam would rise to 11 this weekend while AccuWeather said it would reach 13 on Saturday and Sunday.
The region has been battered by a severe heat wave over the past days.
Weather agencies forecast the UV index in Hanoi would reach 12 this Saturday but deem down to moderate levels on Sunday, thanks to a couple thunderstorms.
A heatwave began affecting northern, north-central, and central localities on Monday, raising the mercury across these regions to between 35 and 38 degrees Celsius, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
From Thursday until the weekend, the heat wave would continue hitting southern regions and the Central Highlands as well as south central provinces with temperatures reaching 35-37 degrees Celsius from noon to 3 p.m., it added.
Capital Hanoi braced as the temperature reached up to 35-37 degrees Celsius this week and is expected to stay there during the weekend, according to AccuWeather, which said real feel temperatures can reach 44 degrees Celsius on Saturday and drop to 42 degrees Celsius.
Weather Online said Hanoi's temperatures would reach 34-35 degrees Celsius this weekend while Vietnam's national forecast center said some places in the city can be affected by 40 degrees Celsius.
Statistics show since the beginning of the year, the average temperature across Vietnam reached 1 to 2.5 degrees Celsius higher than previous years, with the upward trend forecast to last till October.
Major heat waves are forecast to hit northern provinces in May and June, while scorching hot temperatures in north-central and central provinces will last till August.
Experts have advised residents to avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 10 a.m and 3 p.m and to wear sunscreen, sunglasses and brimmed hats if venturing out under the sun.
According to Le Thi Xuan Lan, a weather pundit based in southern Vietnam, a tropical depression is likely to form in the Pacific Ocean near the Philippines in early May, which will result in rain falling across multiple areas, including southern regions.
The rainy season is hoped to alleviate drought and saltwater intrusion that plaguing provinces in southern and central regions over the past months, Lan added.
On March 24 Việt Nam capped exports of rice to ensure food security after the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.
It is the world's third-largest exporter after India and Thailand.
Last year the country exported 6.37 million tonnes worth US$2.81 billion, with its top markets being the Philippines (2.1 million tonnes), Ivory Coast (580,000 tonnes), Malaysia (550,000 tonnes), and China (477,000 tonnes).
Exports in the first two months of this year had topped 890,000 tonnes and fetched $410 million, increases of 27 per cent and 32.6 per cent year-on-year.
According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the country is projected to grow 43.5 million tonnes of the grain this year, nearly 30 million tonnes of which will be used for domestic consumption and the rest will be exported.
Binh Thuan declares drought emergency.
Given the prolonged heat wave in the region, tens of thousands of residents in Binh Thuan Province are facing a shortage of water, prompting the provincial government to declare a drought emergency.
With the drought worsening, Nguyen Ngoc Hai, chairman of the south-central coastal province of Binh Thuan, on May 7 signed the decision on the level-two emergency.
The province's chairman told the Binh Thuan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to collaborate with the relevant agencies to determine which areas had been affected by the drought and to adopt response measures quickly.
Certain construction projects, among other things, need to be started to ensure an adequate water supply for daily use and the water volume of reservoirs must be closely monitored, the local media reported.
A report by the Binh Thuan Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue showed that over the past six months, there has been no rain in Binh Thuan Province.
The prolonged scorching heat has resulted in the destruction of some 15,000 hectares of crops.
Besides this, the drought has left 25,000 households holding 93,000 people without sufficient clean water.
Rivers, streams and drilling wells in the Ham Tan, Tanh Linh and Duc Linh districts have dried up, along with reservoirs in the province, including Ba Bau, Song Mong, Ta Mon and Da Bac.
Severe water shortages have hit the Ham Tan, Ham Thuan Nam and Ham Thuan Bac districts in the province.
Residents in many parts of Binh Thuan Province have had to buy water from other areas at prices ranging from VND80,000 to VND120,000 per cubic meter to serve their daily activities.
Vingroup to give 2,400 ventilators to Russia and Ukraine.
Vingroup will give 2,400 invasive ventilators to Russia and Ukraine to help treat COVID-19 cases in the two countries between May 15 to August 30.
The embassy of the Russian Federation in Việt Nam and the embassy of Ukraine in Việt Nam signed an agreement to receive the ventilators on May 6 in Hà Nội.
The invasive ventilators include Vsmart VFS-410 and VFS-510, the two made in Vietnam invasive ventilators which have been completed and manufactured entirely within the Vingroup ecosystem, with a localisation rate of up to 70 per cent.
Nguyễn Việt Quang, Vice Chairman and CEO of Vingroup said that.
By giving 2,400 invasive ventilators, Vingroup hopes to actively contribute to the effective treatment of medical forces in Russia and Ukraine for patients and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This shows the gratitude of the Group's management to the two countries for their close connection with the start-up process of Vingroup.
In detail, Vingroup will give Russia 1,000 VFS-410 ventilators and 500 VFS-510 ventilators.
while giving Ukraine 600 VFS-410 ventilators and 300 VFS-510 ventilators.
The VFS-410 and VFS-510 ventilators are currently being assessed by quality management agencies and the Medical Council of Vietnam, ensuring compliance with quality standards for product circulation in Viet Nam.
At the same time, Vingroup is promoting the supply of ventilator models for Russia and Ukraine to carry out quality inspection procedures in accordance with their current regulations.
The group will officially hand over 2,400 ventilators after being granted product circulation licences by Russia and Ukraine.
Up to now, Vingroup is one of the pioneering enterprises in Asia in sponsoring and supporting the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic with a total sponsorship fund of nearly VNĐ600 billion (US$25.7 million) excluding funding for investment in manufacturing ventilators.
According to the worldometers.info statistics, by 7am May 6, 2020, there are more than 3.7 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 258,000 deaths around the world.
Russia is gradually becoming the current hotspot of COVID-19, with a total of 155,370 SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and 1,451 deaths.
While Ukraine's Ministry of Health reported a total of 12,697 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 316 deaths as of May 6.
Trump thanks Vietnam for medical supplies and gifts.
U.S President Donald Trump, speaking in a phone conversation with Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on May 6 (Hanoi time), thanked Vietnam and its people for medical supplies and gifts for the United States and American people.
The conversation was conducted at the request of the U.S side, according to the Vietnam News Agency.
Trump highly valued Vietnam's Covid-19 response and expressed his appreciation of Vietnam's facilitation of the supply and transportation of medical supplies to America and its donations of face masks to American frontline workers.
The two countries should continue working together in the fight against Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, he said.
Phuc updated Trump on Vietnam's Covid-19 prevention and control effort and expressed his sympathies over the losses and difficulties that the Americans are facing due to the disease.
However, he said he believes that under the leadership of President Trump, the U.S will be able to put the disease under control and reopen its economy soon.
Phuc hailed the bilateral cooperation between the two nations in combating Covid-19, and thanked the U.S President for offering to present ventilators to Vietnam and providing financial support for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), including nearly US$10 million for Vietnam to improve health care capacity and rehabilitate the economy.
Both sides agreed to step up bilateral economic and trade ties and open up their markets for their goods in the time to come.
Two-way trade between the countries continued to expand in the first quarter of 2020, with U.S exports to Vietnam growing 17% over the same period last year.
The two leaders also exchanged views on how to deepen the bilateral comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and America, especially on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties.
Trump affirmed that the U.S attaches importance to the comprehensive partnership with Vietnam, and said that the Vietnam-U.S relationship has strongly grown over the past 25 years.
On March 26 and April 28, the two leaders exchanged letters on Covid-19.
On the same day, at the request of the U.S side, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh had a phone conversation with U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The two sides agreed that Vietnam-U.S relations have continued expanding in various aspects, especially economy and trade.
They also agreed to work together to organize cooperation activities on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties in 2020, thus deepening the Vietnam-U.S comprehensive partnership.
Pompeo hailed Vietnam's role in responding to common challenges, and agreed to boost coordination to promote ties between ASEAN and the U.S while Vietnam is serving as the ASEAN 2020 Chair and a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
Vietnamese Covid-19 vaccine shows initial effect on mice.
50 mice in the lab remain healthy 10 days after being administered a Covid-19 vaccine produced in Vietnam.
The latest vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at the Company for Vaccine and Biological Production No.1 (VABIOTECH) and the U.K.'s Bristol University.
Dr. Do Tuan Dat, President of VABIOTECH in Hanoi, said.
This is the initial success in the development of Covid-19 vaccine in Vietnam.
Dat said that during the testing phase, researchers experimented by injecting the mice in many ways and administering multiple antigen doses, with some mice injected with one or two doses of 3-10 micrograms each.
After 10 days, the mice are in good health and being closely monitored for immune responses, he said.
Over the next four or five days, researchers will send the mice's blood samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology for first evaluation and the second in the next 14 days.
This is an important stage of research on the Covid-19 vaccine in Vietnam.
If the test is successful on mice, the research team will take their work further and seek funding from international agencies.
According to Dat, the main ingredient in the vaccine is a strain carrying Covid-19 antigens that scientists successfully generated in the lab and tested on other animals with good results.
So it is reasonable to expect the vaccine given to mice is also safe, he said.
After gaining positive results with immune response and antibody production, researchers will continue to develop complete vaccines and production technologies on many different scales, he added.
The institute estimates it will take at least 12-18 months to develop a Covid-19 vaccine that can work safely on humans.
A vaccine is generally considered the most effective way to fight a viral disease.
There are currently no approved vaccines or medication for the Covid-19, which has killed more than 265,600 people worldwide and infected more than 3.8 million.
Around 150 Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being conducted worldwide.

China repatriates 30 illegal Vietnamese farmworkers.
China has sent back 30 illegal Vietnamese farmworkers, and they have been quarantined for 14 days to ensure they do not have Covid-19.
Border forces in China's Yunnan Province last Saturday handed over the eight men and 22 women to their counterparts in Lao Cai Province.
The workers, many of them ethnic H'Mong people, had reportedly crossed into China through paths looking for jobs on banana and rubber farms in Yunnan since November last year.
When the Covid-19 pandemic began in December Chinese authorities sought to identify foreign workers to contain the spread of the virus and found these Vietnamese had entered illegally.
They placed them in detention for more than three months before sending them home.
At the Lao Cai border, the returnees had to make health declarations and were then sent to a quarantine center for 14 days.
Lao Cai has set up 13 quarantine centers.
Last month it received 500 workers returning from China, border authorities said.
They went to that country legally, but had to return since Chinese factories have been laying off workers due to the impact of the pandemic.
China, where Covid-19 first broke out in Wuhan City last December before spreading to 211 other countries and territories around the world, has reported more than 82,000 cases of infection and 4,633 deaths.
Discharged Covid-19 patient dies of liver cirrhosis in Vietnam.
A 64-year-old man from Ha Nam Province, who was discharged after testing Covid-19 negative four times, died last Friday of liver cirrhosis, the Health Ministry said Monday night.
Patient 251, who tested positive for the virus on April 7, was treated at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi.
He was discharged from the hospital on April 17 after testing negative four times in a row and transferred to the Ha Nam General Hospital in the northern province of Ha Nam for treatment of liver cirrhosis.
Since March 20, he had been treated at the Ha Nam General Hospital's gastroenterology department for liver cirrhosis, exhaustion, and severe gout.

PM officially gives green light to export of medical face masks.
Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc has given the green light to the export of medical face masks without any caps on export volume so that Việt Nam would not miss out on the opportunity of becoming the world's face mask factory amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Government's Resolution No 60/NQ-CP dated April 29 removed Resolution No 20's regulation on licences for export of medical face masks.
Under Resolution 20 dated February 20, medical face masks could only be exported for international aid and assistance provided by the Government with export volume capped at 25 percent of the producer's total output.
The Prime Minister also asked the ministry to propose appropriate measures on managing medical face masks based on the development of the pandemic and the domestic demand to ensure adequate supply for the domestic market.
In addition, the ministries of health, and industry and trade must make public the list of face mask producers and their production capacity and export volume.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) must enhance management and inspection to prevent speculation of face masks and raw materials as well as the production of poor-quality products.
Producers must be responsible for their product quality and pledge to supply medical organizations when required.
Customs statistics showed that Việt Nam exported 415.7 million face masks worth US$63.19 million from January 1 to April 19, mainly to Japan, the Republic of Korea, Germany, and the US.
According to the MoIT, 50 domestic producers which reported to the ministry alone had a total production capacity of eight million face masks per day.
Films that aren't released in theaters are still able to contend for the 2021 Oscars.
The acute respiratory infection pandemic, COVID-19 has caused Hollywood's movie capital to face an unprecedented fact,which is that all films released in 2020 may not be shown at theaters.
In addition, the U.S movie theaters have been closed since mid-March, it remains unclear when they will be reopened.
Therefore, on April 28, it was the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) that made a decision to make an important change to the rules on how they will consider films for this award, which films that aren't released in theaters are still eligible for the 2021 Oscars.
According to the traditional Oscars rules, what AMPAS stipulates is that a film would have to be shown at least 7 days in movie theaters in order to be considered for the world's most prestigious film award.
Once movie theaters are reopened, AMPAS will make the next decision on when to stop the above-mentioned flexible rule.
Vietnam tests Covid-19 vaccine on mice.
The Covid-19 vaccine was developed after scientists successfully generated the novel coronavirus antigen in the lab, said Dr. Do Tuan Dat, President of the Company for Vaccine and Biological Production No.1 (VABIOTECH) in Hanoi.
Antigen units are the most important ingredient in vaccine production, helping the body process antigens.
After testing the vaccine in mice for two weeks, scientists will conduct blood tests on the animal, sending samples to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology.
Dat said the vaccine will be tested further in animals and evaluated for safety and effectiveness before a manufacturing process is embarked on.
The vaccine has been developed by collaborating scientists at VABIOTECH and the U.K.'s Bristol University.
A vaccine is said to be the most effective way to fight against a viral disease.
Produced from weakened virus or a protein or other small pieces taken from it, a vaccine trains the body's immune system to fight the disease it has not come into contact with before.
There are currently no approved vaccines or medication for the Covid-19, which has killed nearly 245,000 people worldwide and infected almost 3.5 million.
Around 150 Covid-19 vaccine development projects are being conducted worldwide.
Big breakfasts help us burn double the calories.
Researchers have revealed what might be a highly popular new way to lose weight - eat a big breakfast.
It could become the biggest diet fad ever for those wishing to shed a few kilos.
Scientists in Germany conducted a study on how a hearty breakfast affected the body's metabolism in a laboratory experiment.
Sixteen men ate a low-calorie breakfast and high-calorie dinner one day, and reversed this with a high-calorie breakfast and low-calorie dinner the next.
Eating a larger breakfast and a smaller dinner boosted a process called diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT).
This is the generation of heat in the body that burns up calories.
This happened even when the total calories consumed throughout the day remained the same.
Eating a big breakfast led to 2.5 times higher rates of DIT.
Researcher Dr Juliane Richter spoke about the findings of her investigation.
She said, Our results show a meal eaten for breakfast, regardless of the number of calories it contains, creates twice as high DIT as the same meal consumed for dinner.
This finding is significant for all people as it underlines the value of eating enough at breakfast.
Vietnam reports new coronavirus case tonight.
A British oil expert has tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the country's total number of confirmed cases to 271 tonight, May 3, according to the Ministry of Health.
The 37-year-old man, who works at Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam), arrived at HCMC-based Tan Son Nhat International Airport, with 12 other experts on April 28.
After their arrival, they were sent to a quarantine center in the city's outlying district of Can Gio, thus posing no risks for community spread.
All the experts first tested negative for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, on April 28.
However, the second test results showed one, now the 271st patient, had the virus on May 2.
The patient is being treated at the city's Cu Chi Field Hospital.
Among 271 Covid-19 patients, 219 cases have made a full recovery and there have been no coronavirus fatalities, the local media reported.
China is trying to revive its economy without risking more lives.
China is trying to jump-start its huge economy without triggering a second wave of coronavirus cases.
It's a high-stakes experiment that could provide clues for countries agonizing over how long to keep their shutdowns in place as a global recession begins and millions of jobs are lost.
The country where the pandemic began was almost completely shut down in late January as the number of coronavirus cases mounted.
The drastic measures appear to have brought the virus under control.
Locally transmitted infections have plummeted, and a lockdown on most of Hubei province — ground zero of the pandemic — is being lifted this week.
But the lockdown also brought activity in much of the world's second biggest economy to a standstill for weeks on end, and is likely to result in China's first contraction in decades.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs recently forecast that China's GDP may fall by 9% in the first quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2019.
The Chinese government knows that its actions to contain the virus came at the expense of the country's economic health.
Now authorities are trying to ensure that those consequences are short lived.
The economic losses have become intolerable, Xingdong (XD) Chen, chief China economist for BNP Paribas, told CNN Business, adding that the government has to balance resuming work while remaining vigilant.
I don't think it is right to restart business and production only when the virus has totally disappeared.
Vietnam ends 16th day without Covid-19 community transmission.
The Health Ministry confirmed no new coronavirus cases Saturday evening, marking the 16th consecutive day Vietnam has gone without community transmission of Covid-19.
Of the 270 patients recorded so far, 217 have been discharged and 53 are undergoing treatment, including 14 relapsed patients.
Of the relapses, five are in Hanoi and six in Ho Chi Minh City including the latest two cases confirmed Saturday.
The northern province of Quang Ninh has reported two relapsed patients and the south central province of Binh Thuan one.
So far, Vietnam has gone eight days without new infections.
The latest patients, announced last Friday evening, were both students studying in Japan who returned to the Van Don Airport in Quang Ninh on April 22.
They were quarantined on arrival and are now under treatment at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Hanoi.
Nearly 30,000 people are quarantined in the country – 244 in hospitals specialized for Covid-19 treatment, over 5,500 at centralized facilities and the rest at home.
The health ministry also said Saturday that three critically-ill Covid-19 patients in Vietnam have overcome the most difficult stage.
The Covid-19 pandemic has spread to 212 countries and territories, with almost 240,000 deaths reported so far.
Việt Nam exports nearly 416 million face masks.
Việt Nam exported 415.7 million face masks worth US$63.19 million from January 1 to April 19, according to the General Department of Customs.
Between April 1 and 19 there were 88.19 million face masks worth $344 million exported, including 51.3 million that were gifts and donations.
Japan was the biggest importer of made-in-Vietnam face masks in the period, with 32.7 million, followed by the Republic of Korea, Germany, and the US, with 17.1 million, 11.1 million, and 10.4 million, respectively.
In early April, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc approved the export of medical face masks and protective clothing, as long as domestic demand, including reserves, is met first.
Such products can therefore only be exported to countries that have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Ministry of Health's figures showed that there are some 68 companies producing medical face masks and protective clothing in Việt Nam.
Some garment companies are also investing in producing medical face masks, besides cloth face masks, such as the Garment 10 Corporation Joint Stock Company and TNG Investment and Trading Joint Stock Company.
The Vietnam Trade Office in the EU has warned that the mass production of medical face masks and protective clothing that do not follow technical standards will cause oversupply and damage if such products cannot be exported.
Trần Thanh Hải, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Industry and Trade's Import-Export Department, urged face mask producers to pay attention to quality and safety requirements and obtain the necessary certificates for export.

New Zealand has 'won battle' against community transmission of Covid-19.
New Zealand's prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said the country has stopped the widespread community transmission of Covid-19, as tough lockdown restrictions are scheduled to ease on Monday night.

We have won that battle.
But we must remain vigilant, she said.
At 11.59pm on Monday, New Zealand will lift its level-4 lockdown which has been in place for more than four weeks.
During that time, almost all businesses have been closed, along with schools while the population has been asked to remain in their homes for all but supermarket visits and short walks.
Ardern said there was no way of knowing what may have happened without the level-4 lockdown.
But she warned that in level-3 there were new risks – namely people coming into more contact with others.
Level 3 will see retailers, restaurants and schools allowed to reopen on a smaller scale.
Schools will reopen on Wednesday for children up to Year 10 who cannot study from home, or whose parents need to return to work.
Workers will also be able to resume on-site work, provided they have a Covid-19 control plan in place, with appropriate health and safety and physical distancing measures.

Alibaba Demotes Tmall Boss Jiang Fan, Says Personal Scandal Damaged Company Reputation.
Alibaba announced on April 27 that Jiang Fan, the head of its e-commerce business units and a partner at the company, will be demoted as a punishment for his personal scandals damaging the company's image.
Jiang will be removed as one of the company's 38 partners, and demoted from Senior Vice President to VP, down one level from M7 to M6, according to Alibaba's internal managerial level guidebook.
He will also be deprived of all bonuses from the previous financial year.
Jiang will still keep his job as the head of Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall, two of China's leading e-commerce websites.
Earlier this month, Dong Yang, wife of the executive, accused of Zhang Dayi, a popular Chinese influencer who also runs several fashion-focused companies that operate on Alibaba's platforms, of seducing Jiang.
Ruhnn Holdings, Zhang's holding company, owns several of the top performing shops on Tmall and Taobao, and was invested by Alibaba in 2016.
An internal investigation that began two weeks ago found that dealings between Ruhnn Holdings and the business units Jiang leads did not show signs of misconduct, such as profit transferring.
Jiang was not included in the decision that led to Alibaba investing in Ruhnn Holdings.
The investigation found, however, that Jiang's failure to properly handle his family affairs had caused a public opinion crisis and severely damaged the company's reputation.
Jiang, 35, is one of the youngest top executives at Alibaba.
Started as an engineer in Google China, he later went on to co-found Umeng, the mobile-focused data services provider that Alibaba acquired in 2013.
Jiang became the president of Taobao in 2017, and took over Tmall in 2019.
Jiang is also a member of Alibaba's strategic execution committee.

For the PCR test method, Deputy Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long stated that in the initial period, Vietnam used biological products from foreign countries but later developed these products for PCR to replace the foreign source.
Vietnam has to date tested 212,000 samples and recorded 270 cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The rate of positive findings reached 0.13%.
The Vietnam-made test kits for the PCR method have been recognized by the World Health Organization and the United Kingdom.
As such, Covid-19 test kits manufactured in Vietnam can be sold on the global market, the local media reported.
For the quick test method, the representative of the Ministry of Health explained that Vietnam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology had worked with a Japanese university to develop rapid test kits with high efficiency.
Vietnam is the world's fifth country to successfully manufacture this type of quick test kit.
Vietnam to export litchi to Japan for first time.
Bac Giang Province expects to export Vietnam's first ever batch of litchi to Japan in late May, heard attendees at a meeting between Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Nguyen Xuan Cuong and the province's leaders on April 26.
Vice Chairman of the province Lai Thanh Son said the provincial authorities have worked closely with traders and farmers to ensure the farming processes and litchi quality meet Japan's requirements and to help them manage their processing, packaging and sterilization system.
All preparations for litchi exports to Japan are nearly complete.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan wrote to the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in mid-December 2019 approving the import of Vietnam's litchis following five years of talks between the two sides.
Previously, Japan had opened its market to Vietnamese dragon fruit and mangoes.
Bac Giang Province is the largest producer of litchis in Vietnam, with 28,000 hectares of land and an estimated yield of 160,000 tons.
Some 15,000 hectares (53%) meet the VietGAP standard and 80 hectares meet the GlobalGAP standard.
The province also ships litchis to China, the United States and the European Union.
South Korean officials call for caution amid reports that North Korean leader Kim is ill.
South Korean officials are calling for caution amid reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may be ill, emphasising that they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea.
At a closed door forum on Sunday, South Korea's Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, said the government has the intelligence capabilities to say with confidence that there was nothing unusual happening.
Rumours and speculation over the North Korean leader's health began after he made no public appearance at a key state holiday on April 15, and has since remained out of sight.
South Korea media last week reported that Kim may have undergone cardiovascular surgery or was in isolation to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus.
On Monday, North Korean state media once again showed no new photos of Kim nor reported on his whereabouts.
However, they did carry reports that he had sent a message of gratitude to workers building a tourist resort in Wonsan, an area where some South Korean media reports have said Kim may be staying.
Last week China dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un.
Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Kim's health.
On Friday a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim Jong Un was alive and would likely make an appearance soon.
Experts have cautioned that Kim has disappeared from state media coverage before, and that gathering accurate information in North Korea is notoriously difficult.
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11.
Kim, believed to be 36, vanished from state media for more than a month in 2014 and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.
China sent team including medical experts to advise on North Korea's Kim.
China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader.
Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signaled in terms of Kim's health.
A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday.
The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.
The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.
Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12.
South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.
On Thursday, U.S President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Kim was gravely ill.
I think the report was incorrect, Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.
On Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon.
An official familiar with U.S intelligence said that Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.
A U.S State department spokeswoman had no comment.
U.S Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim's health on Fox News after Trump spoke said, I don't have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we're watching the situation very keenly.
North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security.
Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Kim's whereabouts or condition.
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11.
Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before.
In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.
Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.
When Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.
Five dead as flashfloods, landslides hit northern Vietnam.
Heavy floods and landslides triggered by torrential rains in northern Vietnam over the past three days have left five dead and over 10,300 houses damaged.
From April 22 to 24, a cold spell combined with the convergence of high winds caused heavy rain in the northern mountainous region, with rainfall in many areas of up to 130 mm a day.
Lai Chau Province reported two deaths while Ha Giang, Son La and Yen Bai reported one death each, according to the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control.
Twenty-five others have been injured and some are still missing, the committee said.
The total damage so far is estimated at VND130 billion ($5.5 million), with 10,330 houses damaged and over 3,000 hectares of rice and other crops destroyed.
Lai Chau has issued flash flood and landslide warnings to all areas, and residents of some houses in vulnerable locations haver been evacuated to safer areas.
The National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting said northern mountainous provinces will experience heavy rains until Sunday.
Lai Chau, Dien Bien and Lao Cai provinces are at high risk of flashfloods and landslides, it said.
Natural disasters, mostly floods and landslides, killed 133 people in Vietnam last year and caused losses worth around VND7 trillion ($302.6 million), according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
Nearly 10,000 overseas Vietnamese to return home to shun pandemic.
The health authority in HCMC has been told to be prepared to receive and quarantine an estimated 10,000 Vietnamese returnees from abroad amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Of these, 300 Vietnamese students in the United States are expected to arrive in the city through Tan Son Nhat International Airport on April 27, municipal chairman Nguyen Thanh Phong said at a meeting on Covid-19 infection prevention and control on April 24.
He asked the HCMC Health Department to take steps to send these returnees to isolation centers right after their arrival, reported Dan Tri newsite.
The city's leader cited examples of two Vietnamese students returning from Japan recently and testing positive for the new coronavirus, noting that extreme caution should be maintained during the fight against the coronavirus.
Speaking at the meeting, Nguyen Huu Hung, deputy director of the municipal Health Department, said that Vietnam National University HCMC's dormitory, which was requisitioned as a centralized isolation center, must be resumed to its original state soon, as students are to return to school soon.
Accordingly, agencies have to closely cooperate to set up additional quarantine facilities to assist with the city's efforts to combat Covid-19, Hung said.
To date, the city has reported 54 Covid-19 infections, with 53 cases having recovered.
The remaining Covid-19 case, confirmed as the 91st patient, is a British pilot who is under treatment at the HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases.
Vietnam reports two new Covid-19 cases after eight days.
The Ministry of Health, April 24, confirmed two new coronavirus cases after eight consecutive days without any new case reported.
Up to now, Vietnam has reported 270 coronavirus cases, with 245 of them having recovered.
Two new cases are Vietnamese students returning home from Japan on April 21.
The 269th patient is a 23-year-old man residing in Viet Yen District, Bac Giang Province, while the 270th patient is a 22-year-old woman in Yen Dung District in the same province.
They were on the same flight with 160 other passengers residing in 32 cities and provinces.
All of them were transported to Thai Binh Province for quarantine right after arriving at Van Don Airport in Quang Ninh.
We took samples from the passengers for Covid-19 testing on April 21 and two of them tested positive.
The two patients are now being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases, said Pham Van Diu, director of the Thai Binh Province Department of Health.
Forty-eight of the passengers are pregnant and seven are children, according to Diu.
Australian foreign minister condemns China's disruptive actions.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Thursday she was concerned about China's disruptive activities in the East Sea, including the sinking of a Vietnamese boat.
Australia was concerned over reported efforts to disrupt other countries' resource development activities, the declaration of new 'administrative districts' over disputed features, and the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat, reportedly in a collision with a Chinese coast guard vessel, by The Sydney Morning Herald.
They were her first comments on the issue in the East Sea, known internationally as the South China Sea.
She said that Australia had a strong interest in the stability of this crucial waterway and the norms and laws that govern it.
It is vital at this time that all parties refrain from destabilizing activities and work to ease tensions so the international community can devote full attention to responding cooperatively to the Covid-19 pandemic, she said.
Australian frigate HMAS Parramatta has joined three U.S warships for an exercise in the South China Sea this week.
They arrived close to where the Chinese government survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 has been operating, Reuters reported.
The Chinese vessel was spotted inside sea areas about 352 km away from Bruneian and Malaysian coasts by ship tracking website Marine Traffic on April 16.
On April 14, it had reportedly appeared at 158 km (98 miles) off Vietnam's coast, within Vietnam's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).
HCMC stops taking test samples at airport, railway stations.
Having passed 16 days without a new patient being diagnosed with the novel coronavirus in HCMC, the city's Center for Disease Control and Prevention today, April 23, has stopped taking samples from arriving passengers at Saigon Railway Station and Tan Son Nhat International Airport for Covid-19 testing.
The city is still checking the body temperatures of people arriving at 62 checkpoints.
From April 4 to 22, the city center took over 13,800 samples from travelers at the airport and some 5,600 samples from travelers at the railway station, the local media reported.
The test results of these samples, except for the sample of the 22nd case, who tested positive for the virus after being discharged from a hospital in Danang City, came back negative for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, proving there was no risk of community spread.
Nguyen Tri Dung, director of the city center, noted that the city is treating only two coronavirus patients at the moment, with one having tested negative for Covid-19 three times and the other being the 91st case, a British pilot working for Vietnam Airlines.
The center is collaborating with the HCMC Food Safety Management Board to build a set of criteria to assess food safety and Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures applicable to factories and companies, said Dung.
Covid-19 fraud.
Hanoi CDC officials inflated test kit prices by $200,000.
For now, most real-time PRC machines are produced in Germany and several other European countries, and cost between VND2.5 billion and VND10 billion each, depending on their capacity and configuration.
Cam, the Hanoi CDC director, and six other suspects in the case were arrested Wednesday.
Police said the CDC officials had conspired to cheat and raise the price of a bidding package for the real-time PCR system.
Cam is under investigation along with Nguyen Vu Ha Thanh, head of the agency's financial accounting department.
Le Xuan Tuan, an employee of the department.
Dao The Vinh, director of the Vietnam Scientific and Material Science Company Limited.
Nguyen Tran Duy, director of the Nhan Thanh Property Valuation and Auction company.
Nguyen Ngoc Nhat, an employee of the Vitech Development Company Limited.
and Nguyen Thanh Tuyen, an employee of the Eastern Medical Equipment Company.
They will be probed on charges of violating bidding regulations causing serious consequences, an offence that can fetch jail terms of up to 20 years.
The Hanoi CDC has been in charge of Covid-19 testing for the entire capital city, with 2,500-3,000 samples taken each day.
VinAI Research announces state-of-the-art face recognition technology.
VinAI Research, under Vingroup, announced on April 20 that it has successfully developed state-of-the-art technology that allows users to use face recognition to unlock their devices without removing their face masks.
Designed with the principles of deep learning, VinAI's face recognition technology enables phone cameras to identify users even if their faces are partially covered.
VinAI said it is willing to share the technology free of charge with programs that contribute to coronavirus infection prevention and control.
Bui Hai Hung, director of VinAI Research, noted that face masks are an essential item for people during the coronavirus pandemic.
However, the accuracy of existing facial recognition technologies can be reduced by more than 50% if users wear face masks.
By using VinAI's face recognition technology, people can easily unlock their phones without having to remove their masks, thus preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
VinAI has also developed a solution that automatically monitors people wearing masks on cameras.
This solution will be helpful for organizations and companies when they resume operations after the pandemic.
Vietnam rejects China's sovereign claims in East Sea.
The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on April 23 that it has contacted the Chinese side to reaffirm Vietnam's standpoint on East Sea issues and reject China's illegal sovereignty claims over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes.
China has recently stepped up its assertiveness and illegal expansion in the disputed waters.
After a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel rammed into a Vietnamese fishing boat while it was fishing near the Paracel Archipelago in early April, China announced on April 18 the establishment of Xisha District on Paracel Archipelago and Nansha District on Spratly Archipelago.
On April 19, China officially published the names of 25 islands and reefs and 55 seafloor geographical entities, most of which are located on the two archipelagos.
China's Foreign Ministry has also sent a diplomatic note to the United Nations lodging stern representations in response to what it called Vietnam's illegal claims in the East Sea.
It also threatened any attempt to deny China's sovereignty there will be doomed to fail.
Responding to inquiries about reactions of Vietnam on China's recent moves at a press meeting on April 23,Ngo Toan Thang, deputy spokesperson of the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Vietnam has submitted a claim to the United Nations to affirm its sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes in accordance with international laws.
China's recent expansions in the East Sea go against the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and seriously violate the sovereignty of Vietnam.
Vietnam has sufficient historical evidence and a legal foundation to assert its sovereignty over the Paracel and Spratly archipelagoes, Thang said.
Earlier on April 19,Le Thi Thu Hang, spokesperson of Vietnam's Foreign Ministry, said Vietnam strongly protests China's establishment ofXisha and Nansha districts and put them under the jurisdiction of Sansha City.
China's establishment of the so-called Sansha City and related acts are invalid and unrecognized, and they are detrimental to the friendship between countries and will further complicate the situation in the East Sea, the region and the world, Hang said.
Vietnam passes one week with zero new Covid-19 cases.
Vietnam reported no fresh Covid-19 infections this morning, April 23, marking a full week in which the country's total number of coronavirus cases was kept unchanged at 268.
Of the total, 223 patients have made a full recovery and been discharged from hospital, according to the national steering committee for Covid-19 infection prevention and control.
Among the 45 cases under treatment at eight medical centers, 11 patients have tested negative once or twice for the virus, the local media reported.
Meanwhile, the three critically ill patients, including the 19th and 161st receiving treatment at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Dong Anh District, Hanoi City and the 91st under treatment at HCMC Hospital for Tropical Diseases, have shown some health improvements.
Despite the positive signal, residents should not be inattentive and should continue to strictly follow Covid-19 infection prevention and control measures, including wearing face masks, avoiding mass gatherings and standing apart from one another, said Associate Professor Dr Tran Dac Phu, former head of the General Department of Preventive Medicine.
